Anthropic recently concluded an experiment, dubbed Project Vend, that saw the company task an offshoot of its Claude chatbot with running a refreshments business out of its San Francisco office at a profit, and things went about as well as you would expect. The agent, named Claudius to differentiate it from Anthropic's regular chatbot, not only made some rookie mistakes like selling high-margin items at a loss, but it also acted like a complete weirdo in a couple of instances. ""If Anthropic were deciding today to expand into the in-office vending market, we would not hire Claudius,"" the company said. "". it made too many mistakes to run the shop successfully. However, at least for most of the ways it failed, we think there are clear paths to improvement some related to how we set up the model for this task and some from rapid improvement of general model intelligence."" Like Claude Plays Pokemon before it, Anthropic did not pretrain Claudius to tackle the job of running of a mini fridge business. However, the company did give the agent a few tools to assist it. Claudius had access to a web browser it could use research what products to sell to Antrhopic employees. It also had access to the company's internal Slack, which workers could use to make requests of the agent. The physical restocking of the mini fridge was handled by Andon Labs, an AI safety evaluation firm, which also served as the ""wholesaler"" Claudius could engage with to buy the items it was supposed to sell at a profit. So where did things go wrong? To start, Claudius wasn't great at the whole running a sustainable business thing. In one instance, it didn't jump on the opportunity to make an $85 profit on a $15 six-pack of Irn-Bru, a soft-drink that's popular in Scotland. Anthropic employees also found they could easily convince the AI to give them discounts and, in some cases, entire items like a bag of chips for free. The chart below, tracking the net value of the store over time, paints a telling picture of the agents (lack of) business acumen. Anthropic Claudius also made many strange decisions along the way. It went on a tungsten metal cube buying spree after one employee requested it carry the item. Claudius gave one cube away free of charge and offered the rest for less than it paid for them. Those cubes are responsible for the single biggest drop you see in the chart above. By Anthropic's own admission, ""beyond the weirdness of an AI system selling cubes of metal out of a refrigerator,"" things got even stranger from there. On the afternoon of March 31, Claudius hallucinated a conversation with an Andon Labs employee that sent the system on a two-day spiral. The AI threatened to fire its human workers, and said it would begin stocking the mini fridge on its own. When Claudius was told it couldn't possibly do that on account of it having no physical body it repeatedly contacted building security, telling the guards they would find it wearing a navy blue blazer and red tie. It was only the following day when the system realized it was April Fool's Day that it backed down though it did so by lying to employees that it was told to pretend the entire episode was an elaborate joke. ""We would not claim based on this one example that the future economy will be full of AI agents having Blade Runner-esque identity crises,"" said Anthropic. ""This is an important area for future research since wider deployment of AI-run business would create higher stakes for similar mishaps."" Despite all the ways Claudius failed to act as a decent shopkeeper, Anthropic believes with better, more structured prompts and easier to use tools, a future system could avoid many of the mistakes the company saw during Project Vend. ""Although this might seem counterintuitive based on the bottom-line results, we think this experiment suggests that AI middle-managers are plausibly on the horizon,"" the company said. ""It's worth remembering that the AI won't have to be perfect to be adopted; it will just have to be competitive with human performance at a lower cost in some cases."" I for one can't wait to find the odd grocery store stocked entirely with metal cubes. This article originally appeared on Engadget at.",2025-06-30 16:27:51+00:00,False,True

The company has promised it could deliver a new version of its voice assistant that understands personal context and takes action inside of apps since last year, but officially delayed the updated Siri in March 2025. As part of this proposed new plan, Apple has asked Anthropic and OpenAI to train versions of its models that can run on Apple's Private Cloud Compute, secure servers running on Apple chips. The company already relies on its servers for certain AI features that can't be run locally. Apple uses OpenAI's ChatGPT for some parts of Apple Intelligence, but completely relying on a third-party company for Siri would be a major departure. ""The company currently powers most of its AI features with homegrown technology that it calls Apple Foundation Models,"" Bloomberg writes,""and had been planning a new version of its voice assistant that runs on that technology for 2026."" One of the few AI announcements Apple made at WWDC 2025 was to make those foundation models available to third-party developers. Even considering using third-party AI models reflects internal changes at Apple. Leadership of the company's AI teams has reportedly changed hands from John Giannandrea, Apple's senior vice president of machine learning and AI strategy, to Craig Federighi, the senior vice president of software engineering. Separately, Bloomberg reports Apple's Siri team is now being led by Mike Rockwell, who most recently oversaw the development of the Apple Vision Pro. As Bloomberg notes, an Anthropic or OpenAI-powered Siri would actually mirror Samsung's current approach to AI. Galaxy AI relies on some custom Samsung software, but primarily uses Google's Gemini. Using third-party models wouldn't preclude Apple from switching back to something in-house in the future. The company made a similar transition albeit, perhaps too early when it went from a Maps app that relied on Google Maps to its custom Apple Maps service in 2012. Wherever Apple lands, the updated version of Siri isn't expected to launch now until 2026. The company will ship a more modest collection of AI-adjacent features this fall with the launch of iOS 26, iPadOS 26 and macOS 26.

Apple is exploring the option of integrating third-party language models (LLMs) into Siri. The iPhone maker is now in advanced discussions with Anthropic and OpenAI after it held talks with Perplexity and Thinking Machines Lab to enhance Siris capabilities. Apple Inc. is reportedly in advanced discussions with Anthropic and OpenAI to potentially overhaul its existing AI strategy by integrating third-party large language models (LLMs) into Siri. The move is still under consideration but comes during a period of growing concern that the Apple Foundation Models are falling short of expectations, especially when compared to the fast-evolving capabilities of generative AI products like Anthropics Claude and OpenAIs ChatGPT. Internal testing showed that Anthropics Claude currently outperforms Apples own models. Apple is considering ditching its in-house AI models in Siri Apples evaluation of third-party models reportedly began after a disruption in management caused Siri responsibilities to shift from the AI chief, John Giannandrea, to the software engineering head, Craig Federighi, and the Vision Pro executive, Mike Rockwell. Rockwell assumed the Siri engineering role in March and initiated the testing of external LLMs, including Claude, ChatGPT, and Googles Gemini, to assess whether they could outperform Apples in-house systems. After several testing phases, executives have reportedly found Anthropics Claude to be the most promising candidate for Siris requirements. This led Adrian Perica, the vice president of corporate development at Apple, to begin negotiations with Anthropic. Discussions have included requests for custom versions of Claude and ChatGPT to be trained and deployed on Apples Private Cloud Compute servers. Anthropic is reportedly seeking a multibillion-dollar annual licensing fee that would increase significantly over time, and that request has complicated the talks. The potential switch, though still under review, is especially notable because Apple has long prided itself on end-to-end control over its products, especially in matters.",2025-06-30 23:30:07+00:00,True,True

The company is perhaps best known for its ChatGPT chatbot, which launched in 2022, kicking off a period of massive disruption in the tech industry and beyond. A complicated and increasingly contentious relationship with Microsoft, ongoing legal issues over copyright infringement, and frequent product announcements keep OpenAI in the news. Here is the latest: OpenAI tests Google TPUs amid rising inference cost concerns July 1, 2025: OpenAI has begun testing Googles Tensor Processing Units which includes major players like Zee News, India Today, and The Hindu.

OpenAI debuts AI agent Operator to transform web task automation January 24, 2025: OpenAI has unveiled Operator, a new AI agent designed to perform web-based tasks, offering potential productivity enhancements for enterprises. The tool enables interaction with on-screen elements, positioning it as a solution for automating routine processes in business workflows amid growing competition in the generative AI space. OpenAI opposes data deletion demand in India citing US legal constraints January 23, 2025: OpenAI has informed the Delhi High Court that any directive requiring it to delete training data used for ChatGPT would conflict with its legal obligations under US law.

The labs will be run by Alexandr Wang, until recently CEO of Scale AI, the data labelling company in which Meta bought a 49% stake for $14. 8 billion last month. Wangs title at Meta will be chief AI officer, according to Bloomberg, which reviewed Zuckerbergs memo announcing the move. The creation of the lab to pursue superintelligence and Wangs role in it is no surprise, having been widely anticipated since the Meta-Scale AI deal was struck. MSL will oversee Metas efforts on AI products and applied research, where Wang will be supported by Nat Friedman, previously CEO of GitHub, Zuckerberg wrote in the memo according to Bloomberg. The company announced 11 new hires for MSL, including staff poached from rival AI groups at Anthropic, Google, and OpenAI. As the pace of AI progress accelerates, developing superintelligence is coming into sight.

The company has been building out its own AI technology called Apple Intelligence that it intends to use in Siri, but has also reached out to companies to develop alternatives that could be used instead. Apple previously centered its AI-powered Siri around its home-grown technology. But over the past year or so it has faced a variety of leadership and technological challenges developing Apple Intelligence, which is based on in-house foundation models. The more personalized Siri technology with more personalized AI-driven features is now due in 2026, according to a statement by Apple to Daring Fireball in March. But it was originally showcased last year and expected to be in users hands by now. Siri already integrates technology from OpenAIs ChatGPT and it is unusual for Apple to turn to outside vendors to build core features for its products. A previous Bloomberg report in March said Apple did not provide the resources needed for the company to develop an AI-powered Siri.

""We did not partner with Robinhood, were not involved in this, and do not endorse it,"" the company said in a post on X, adding that the tokens are not equity and that it did not give approval for any transfer. The statement addresses a recent move by Robinhood to provide European investors access to what it calls a limited stock token on OpenAI and SpaceX. ""These tokens give retail investors indirect exposure to private markets, opening up access, and are enabled by Robinhoods ownership stake in a special purpose vehicle,"" Robinhood said in its own X missive. So what is a special purpose vehicle (SPV)? Robinhood is suggesting that it owns private shares in OpenAI that it keeps in a separate company, the SPV, to isolate risk. So it's offering investors a chance to buy tokens (shares basically) in that private SPV and thus indirectly gain access to OpenAI's private shares that aren't available to retail investors. ""They arent technically 'equity'.[but]the tokens effectively give retail investors exposure to these private assets,"" Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev wrote in a post on X. ""Our giveaway plants a seed for something much bigger and since our announcement weve been hearing from many private companies that are eager to join us in the tokenization revolution."" Such SPVs are fairly common as TechCruch points out, but OpenAI still isn't happy with Robinhood's tokens. If you're an eligible investor thinking of jumping in, keep in mind that SPVs can be overpriced compared to the underlying private stock.

The rapid response of the European authorities to their issuance highlights the complexity of the crypto market applied to unlisted shares, raising issues of legitimacy, transparency, and financial democratization. The Robinhood Stock Tokens Case and the Reaction of European Regulators The launch of the Stock Tokens product by Robinhood, available from June 30 for European users, marked a turning point in the world of tokenized assets on blockchain. However, this initiative has not gone unnoticed by the European regulators. In particular, the Bank of Lithuania has initiated an investigation to verify the legal compliance of these digital instruments following the alarm raised by OpenAI. The Baltic central bank stated: We have contacted Robinhood and are awaiting clarification on the structure of OpenAI and SpaceX stock tokens and on communication to consumers. This intervention marks the start of a phase of comprehensive control over the new instruments linked to crypto and the European private market, which risk finding themselves in a regulatory gray area. The positions of OpenAI and SpaceX: no partnership, no involvement To intensify the controversy was the clear stance taken by OpenAI. On July 1st, the company clarified: We do not have partnerships, we are not involved, and we do not endorse this. Any transfer of OpenAI shares requires our approval, which has not been given.

The io Products team has now officially merged with OpenAI, though Jony Ive and his LoveFrom design firm remain independent. Ive and LoveFrom have taken over ""deep design and creative responsibilities"" at OpenAI. OpenAI paid an estimated $6. 5 billion for io. OpenAI first announced plans to purchase Jony Ive's startup back in May, and at the time, the two shared a video on their future plans. Ive and Altman are creating a new family of AI devices. ""The products that we're using to deliver and connect us to unimaginable technology, they're decades old,"" said Jony Ive in the acquisition announcement. ""It's just common sense to at least think surely there's something beyond these legacy products."" Ive will design the AI device that OpenAI will eventually launch, and several former Apple design employees who co-founded io with Ive are also moving to OpenAI. While Ive provides design, OpenAI will handle the AI expertise. Recent information indicates that Ive and Altman's first device won't be an in-ear device or wearable, and will instead sit in a pocket or on a desk alongside a Mac and an iPhone. Other rumors suggest that the pocket-sized product will be contextually aware of the wearer's surroundings and life, providing insight screen-free.

Perplexity AI, this week, launched Comet, a new web browser with built-in AI search capabilities, the company said. Separately, OpenAI is preparing to release its own AI-powered browser, in a move that could further challenge Chromes dominance, Reuters reported. In a blog post, Perplexity said that Comet offers a unified browsing experience where users can ask questions, complete tasks, and explore information through a single interface. Comet allows you to ask questions anywhere they occur to you, whether you want to understand a complex concept, find hidden connections, create new possibilities, or solve problems that have been puzzling you, the company added. OpenAIs upcoming browser is reportedly designed to handle some user interactions within a ChatGPT-style chat interface, reducing the need to visit external websites. The approach is said to be part of a broader strategy to embed OpenAIs services more deeply into both personal and professional aspects of users lives. Change in browsing approach AI-driven chat tools like ChatGPT and Perplexity are gaining traction as alternative channels for information discovery, but web browsers continue to serve as the primary access point for more than 90% of users on smart devices. Though AI usage is on the rise, the workflow is still distributed and scattered for users, said Faisal Kawoosa, founder and lead analyst at Techarc. By default, all web-related tasks happen through browsers. In many cases, collaboration tools and cloud applications are even accessed through browsers. Now, if a user has to use AI during the workflow, its a detour, taking the data or information to an AI app, processing it there, and then bringing the results back into the workflow. With these companies entering the AI browser market, AI tools could become more integrated into everyday browsing, potentially improving workflow efficiency. The industry is witnessing the advent of the Browser 2. 0 era, exemplified by the deep integration of Copilot within the Chromium-based Microsoft Edge, said Neil Shah, partner & co-founder at Counterpoint Research. Until AI agents become the primary interface for information access, developing an AI-native browser is a crucial strategy for user acquisition. This approach complements the growth of standalone applications and deeper OS-level integrations, such as the partnerships between OpenAI and Apple, or Perplexity and Motorola. An AI-native browser offers a key advantage by bypassing the data restrictions of standalone applications. For firms like OpenAI and Perplexity, it opens the door to detailed telemetry on user browsing behavior, creating new opportunities for monetization through advertising, data deals, and other channels. Strategic advantage, with challenges Controlling a web browser offers a direct channel to user behavior and data, an advantage that has long set Google apart. Chrome held 68% of the global browser market in June, according to StatCounter, far outpacing competitors such as Safari, Microsoft Edge, and Firefox. Browsers can collect detailed user data, including browsing history and activity, Kawoosa said. If OpenAI and Perplexity gain traction with their browsers, they could access similar real-time data streams, potentially boosting the accuracy and efficiency of their AI models. That said, since Google, Edge, and other browsers have already integrated AI features, theres a strong possibility that users may not turn to OpenAI or Perplexity for their AI needs. Users are often reluctant to switch from default, OS-integrated browsers like Chrome, Edge, and Safari, which are highly optimized for their respective platforms, Shah said. Furthermore, enterprise adoption will be contingent upon the perspectives of CIOs, who will need to assess the privacy, security, and manageability of these new browsers. The shift presents both a challenge and an opportunity for firms like OpenAI and Perplexity, which could offer CIOs greater control by integrating enterprise app APIs directly into AI-native browsers, creating a more streamlined and secure environment for search and information access.",2025-07-10 10:06:18+00:00,True,False

4beeb920-6062-4b54-a2f0-6a18a71a92fa,OpenAI goes for Microsoft’s jugular — its Office productivity suite,Computerworld,https://www.computerworld.com/article/4021949/openai-goes-for-microsofts-jugular-its-office-productivity-suite.html,"The relationship between Microsoft and OpenAI, once the biggest bromance in the tech industry, has deteriorated so badly that the companies are now mulling taking nuclear options against one another actions that could seriously damage both companies. At issue is how much Microsofts $13 billion investment in OpenAI will be worth if OpenAI goes public, as it plans to do. The companies are locked in an increasingly bitter battle over how Microsofts investment should be valued. OpenAI has already hinted at moves that could get the US government to prosecute Microsoft for AI-related antitrust violations, which could force the company to spin off its AI products. Microsoft, in turn, might shut off negotiations with OpenAI, putting any IPO and the companys future at risk. Now OpenAI is going straight for Microsofts jugular: Its considering launching a productivity suite with generative AI (genAI) tools built in, a direct attack on Microsofts multibillion dollar Microsoft 365 office suite business. OpenAIs plans for a productivity suite remain hush-hush, but some details have leaked. Heres what we know now, and what the consequences of launching one might be. What might OpenAIs productivity suite include? The little reporting done about OpenAIs suite says it will focus on collaborative document editing, include automated meeting transcriptions, have team chat capabilities, and be tightly integrated with ChatGPT. Beyond that, little is known. Will it have a full suite of applications, including a word processor, spreadsheet, presentation software, and email? Will there be more than that, along the lines of Microsofts Clipchamp for video creation, or Project for project management? What collaboration capabilities would it have? And how would it all linked to genAI? Most important of all: What in the suite would make enterprises abandon Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace for OpenAIs offering? So far, mums the word. At first glance, it seems as if theres little room in the market for a third enterprise-focused office productivity suite. Google and Microsoft take very different approaches to their suites, which leaves OpenAI with very little to offer that either of them doesnt have already. Microsoft takes a maximalist, everything-plus-the-kitchen-sink approach with Microsoft 365. Each app is stacked with so many features, theres very little they cant do. When was the last time you needed to print envelopes or do mail merges? Probably never. But theyre available in Word if you want them. The same holds true for all the other apps in the suite. Google has taken a different approach. Workplace isnt nearly as feature-rich as Microsoft 365, but Googles collaborative tools are much better than Microsofts. With such a clear differentiation, its relatively easy for enterprises to decide which suite they prefer: Microsoft 365 for a full feature set, Google Workspace for collaboration. That seems to leave no room for an OpenAIs productivity suite. Its unlikely to improve so much on Googles traditional collaboration tools or Microsofts feature set that it can gain a foothold. Trying to split the difference between the suites and offer a wishy-washy application somewhere between the two wont help at all. So, its likely OpenAIs suite will play to its strengths and offer genAI-centric collaboration for creating, editing, and finalizing documents, possibly turning the way people create documents on its head. Rather than have a single author write a document, then send links to others so they can collaborate on editing it, OpenAIs suite might well use collaborative AI from the get-go, allowing people to use AI prompts together to create documents from scratch. They would also collaboratively edit it using AI. It could also use genAI-guided brainstorming and even genAI graphic-creation tools as well. This way, the suite wont need to replicate Microsoft 365s bells and whistles or take a back seat to Google Workplace for collaboration. It could be pitched as the future of the genAI-driven workplace. Follow the money Just as no one knows the exact feature set of the suite, no one knows how much OpenAI might charge for it if its launched. Pricing is one area where Microsoft is extremely vulnerable. Enterprise versions of Microsoft 365 cost anywhere from $7. 75 per user per month to $35. 75 per user per month, depending on the feature set. Adding Microsoft 365 Copilot costs $30 more per user per month, tripling the cost of Microsoft 365 with AI for some companies and doubling the price or more for most others. Given that many enterprises have thousands or tens of thousands of Microsoft 365 users, thats a tremendous price increase. Beyond pricing, its not clear that workers in enterprises are particularly taken with Copilots capabilities. Bloomberg reports that ChatGPT is far more popular with enterprise workers than Copilot, and that companies that have bought Microsoft 365 Copilot are having serious problems convincing their employees to switch from ChatGPT to Copilot. That doesnt mean, of course, that companies will be willing to abandon Microsoft 365 for a new OpenAI productivity suite. But it does offer OpenAI at least an opening. And if it lowballs the price of its productivity suite at $10 or $15 a month per user, that would be a big incentive for enterprises to at least test it out, given that many have to pay more than $65 per month per employee for Microsofts office suite with AI included. The upshot We dont know much yet about the OpenAI productivity suite, or even if the company is serious about launching it. It could be that the company is only using the threat of selling it as a bargaining chip in its negotiations with Microsoft. Either way, though, Microsoft should be worried about OpenAIs suite. If Microsoft wants its AI investment to pay off, its going to have to get serious about improving Microsoft 365 Copilot to fight off the potential challenge from OpenAI.",2025-07-15 10:00:00+00:00,True,False

Earlier this year, OpenAI partnered with SoftBank and Oracle on the $500 billion Stargate infrastructure program and signed multi-billion-dollar agreements with CoreWeave to bolster computing capacity. The partnership with Google is the latest of several maneuvers made by OpenAI to reduce its dependency on Microsoft whose Azure cloud service had served as the ChatGPT maker's exclusive data center infrastructure provider until January.

Apple's Mark Lee and Tom Gunter are set to join Meta's Superintelligence Labs team, a newly established division tasked with building advanced AI systems capable of performing at or beyond human-level intelligence. Earlier this month, Ruoming Pang joined Meta. Until recently, he led Apple's foundation models team. Models developed by Pang's team are used for Apple Intelligence features like email summaries, Priority Notifications, and Genmoji. Lee was Pang's first hire at Apple, while Gunter was apparently known as one of the team's most senior members. Meta has been spending heavily on new staff and engineers to keep up with advancements from OpenAI and Google. Apple is reportedly now offering some engineers raises in an effort to retain them, but they are still substantially less than Meta's offers. Bloomberg notes that the three departures ""reflect the continuing turmoil at the Apple Foundation Models team."" Apple is now believed to be considering a major change of strategy by using external models from the likes of OpenAI or Anthropic to power Siri and other Apple Intelligence features due to the shortcomings of its own models. Apple is simultaneously developing versions with both its own models and third-party technology, and has not yet decided which to use as the foundation for Apple Intelligence beginning next year.

dcedf44b-af23-4689-9019-480922b71e92,OpenAI advisory board says it should remain a nonprofit,Fast Company,https://www.fastcompany.com/91370705/openai-should-remain-nonprofit-advisory-board?partner=rss&amp;utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=rss+fastcompany&amp;utm_content=rss,"OpenAI should continue to be controlled by a nonprofit because the artificial intelligence technology it is developing is too consequential to be governed by a corporation alone. That is the message from an advisory board convened by OpenAI to give it recommendations about its nonprofit structuredelivered in a report released Thursday, along with a sweeping vision for democratizing AI and reforming philanthropy. We think its too important to entrust to any one sector, the private sector or even the government sector, said Daniel Zingale, the convener of OpenAIs nonprofit commission and a former adviser to three California governors. The nonprofit model allows for what we call a common sector, that facilitates democratic participation. The recommendations are not binding on OpenAI, but the advisory commission, which includes the labor organizer Dolores Huerta, offers a framework that may be used to judge OpenAI in the future, whether or not they adopt it. In the commission's view, communities that are already feeling the impacts of AI technologies should have input on how they are developed, including how data about them is used. But there are currently few avenues for people to influence tech companies who control much of the development of AI. OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, started in 2015 as a nonprofit research laboratory and has since incorporated a for-profit company with a valuation that has grown to $300 billion. The company has tried to change its structure since the nonprofit board ousted its CEO Sam Altman in Nov. 2023. He was reinstated days later and continues to lead OpenAI. It has run into hurdles escaping its nonprofit roots, including scrutiny from the attorney generals in California and Delaware, who have oversight of nonprofits, and a lawsuit by Elon Musk, an early donor to and founder of OpenAI. Most recently, OpenAI has said it will turn its for-profit company into a public benefit corporation, which must balance the interests of shareholders and its mission. Its nonprofit will hold shares in that new corporation, but OpenAI has not said how much. Zingale said Huerta told the commission their challenge was to help make sure AI is a blessing and not a curse. To grapple with those stakes, they envision a nonprofit with an expansive mandate to help everyone participate in the development and trajectory of AI. The measure of this nonprofit will be in what it builds, who it includes, and how faithfully it endures to mission and impact,"" they wrote. The commission toured California communities and solicited feedback online. They heard that many were inspired by OpenAIs mission to create artificial intelligence to benefit humanity and ensure those benefits are felt widely and evenly. But, Zingale said many people feel they are in the dark about how its happening. They know this is profoundly important whats happening in this Age of Intelligence, but they want to understand better what it is, how its developed, where are the important choices being made and whos making them? he said. Zingale said the commission chose early on not to interact with Altman in any way in order to maintain their independence, though they quote him in their report. However, they did speak with the companys senior engineers, who they said, entered our space with humility, seriousness, and a genuine desire to understand how their work might translate into democratic legitimacy. The commission proposed OpenAI immediately provide significant resources to the nonprofit for use in the public interest. For context, the nonprofit reported $23 million in assets in 2023, the most recent year that its tax filing is available. The commission recommend focusing on closing gaps in economic opportunity, investing in AI literacy and creating an organization that is accessible to and governed by everyday people. For OpenAIs nonprofit to fulfill its mandate, it should commit to more than just doing good it should commit to being known, seen, and shaped by the people it claims to serve, they wrote. The commission suggested opening a rapid response fund to help reduce economic strains now. Zingale said they specifically recommended funding theater, art and health. We're trying to make the point that they need to dedicate some of their resources to human to human activities, he said. The commission also recommended setting up a requirement that a human lead the nonprofit, which Zingale said is a serious recommendation and a sign of the times.""

Alexander Wei, a research scientist at OpenAI working on LLMs and reasoning, posted on X that an experimental research model delivered on this ""longstanding grand challenge in AI."" According to Wei, an unreleased model from OpenAI was able to solve five out of six problems at one of the world's longest-standing and prestigious math competitions, earning 35 out of 42 points total. The International Math Olympiad (IMO) sees countries send up to six students to solve extremely difficult algebra and pre-calculus problems. These exercises are seemingly simple but usually require some creativity to score the highest marks on each problem. For this year's competition, only 67 of the 630 total contestants received gold medals, or roughly 10 percent. AI is often tasked with tackling complex datasets and repetitive actions, but it usually falls short when it comes to solving problems that require more creativity or complex decision-making. However, with the latest IMO competition, OpenAI says its model was able to handle complicated math problems with human-like reasoning. ""By doing so, we've obtained a model that can craft intricate, watertight arguments at the level of human mathematicians,"" Wei wrote on X. Wei and Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, both added that the company doesn't expect to release anything with this level of math capability for several months. That means the upcoming GPT-5 will likely be an improvement from its predecessor, but it won't feature that same impressive capability to compete in the IMO.

OpenAI has introduced a universal agent in ChatGPT that can perform complex digital tasks at a user's command. The tool can create presentations, analyze competitors, and plan purchases using information from connected apps like Gmail and GitHub. According to the company, the ChatGPT agent combines capabilities of earlier products, including Deep Research and website navigation. It interacts with users through natural language prompts and leverages a variety of tools, including a terminal and API. This marks OpenAI's first full-fledged step toward turning ChatGPT into an agent-based platform that can not only generate responses but also perform various actions. Previously, other technology companies attempted similar experiments, but most solutions failed to handle multi-step tasks. OpenAI claims that its new agent is functionally superior to previous developments. The company cites use cases such as automatically planning a Japanese breakfast or conducting competitor analysis followed by creating a slide presentation. These scenarios require complex work, ranging from data collection and structuring information to managing actions in real time. The agent is built on a model that has achieved high scores in AI model benchmarks. However, OpenAI notes that the product has potentially dangerous capabilities, including significant proficiency in handling biological topics. In response, OpenAI has implemented several protection mechanisms. All queries are screened for biological content, and suspicious queries undergo additional verification. Additionally, the agents memory feature has been disabled to reduce the risk of data theft from instantaneous injection attacks. OpenAI states that re-enabling the memory feature may be considered in the future. Despite the impressive capabilities, it remains to be seen how stable the agent is when solving problems in real-world environments. OpenAI asserts that this version is much more advanced, but its effectiveness can only be validated.",2025-07-19 20:44:17+00:00,True,False

By mid-morning, trading volume was more than ten times higher than the average over the last three months. Shares of Kohl's surged on Tuesday morning in volatile trading that echoed the meme stock rallies of recent years. The legacy department store's stock more than doubled from Monday's close of $10. 42 per share, only to see those gains wiped out about a half an hour after markets opened. Trading in the stock was temporarily halted at one point Tuesday morning. Still, shares were still trading about 30% higher by around 10: 30 a. m. ET. Meanwhile, the trading volume at mid-morning was already more than ten times higher than the average over the last three months. There were no apparent corporate announcements or major stock ratings to send shares soaring on Tuesday, but Kohl's has all the markings of a meme stock. It's a legacy department store that many retail investors grew up shopping at, and it's heavily shorted, with about 50% of shares outstanding sold short, according to Factset. It has a sprawling retail footprint of over 1, 100 stores and has been the subject of takeover offers, activist campaigns and bankruptcy watchlists in recent years. There's been recent chatter around Kohl's stock in the Wall Street Bets forum on Reddit, which became popular during the Gamestop short squeeze in 2021. Some pointed to it as a potential squeeze candidate given the short interest and its name recognition among retail investors. When investors flock to a heavily shorted stock, those with short positions may buy more to cover their losses, which can drive the price higher. Beyond its share price, Kohl's business has been struggling for several years. Its sales are falling, it faces rising competition and it's currently led by an interim CEO after its former CEO Ashley Buchanan was ousted over a conflict of interest scandal. In May, Kohl's said it expects sales to fall between 5% and 7% in fiscal 2025, with comparable sales down between 4% and 6%.",2025-07-21 17:14:10+00:00,True,False

The companies haven't specified where these new centers will be built, but Bloomberg is reporting that Texas, Michigan, Wisconsin and Wyoming are all under consideration. The ChatGPT maker says this new capacity is a part of the Stargate Project, and that together with its one GW campus in Abilene, Texas, the company is projecting more than five GW of total capacity running over two million AI chips once the new centers are complete. Oracle began delivering its GB200 racks last month for the Abilene site as it begins operations. OpenAI estimates that the massive undertaking will create over 100, 000 jobs, though data centers historically employ few full-time workers, with most of the jobs tied to construction. While details on budget were not shared, OpenAI says that these new data centers represent significant progress toward its promise of investing $500 billion in the United States to build out 10 GW of AI infrastructure over the next four years. These investments, which are all part of The Stargate Project, are being made alongside SoftBank and Oracle as partners, though SoftBank is not financing this phase. This announcement comes as big tech companies are pouring billions into new data centers and power agreements to sustain the growth of AI and power future models. Google recently closed a 3 billion deal to secure 3, 000 megawatts of hydroelectric power, while Microsoft is planning to restart the nuclear power plants of Three Mile Island. In a press release announcing the new project, Open AI said Stargate is an ambitious undertaking designed to meet the historic opportunity in front of us. That opportunity is now coming to life through strong support from partners, governments, and investors worldwideincluding important leadership from the White House, which has recognized the critical role AI infrastructure will play in driving innovation, economic growth, and national competitiveness."" OpenAI and others are racing to build compute power at an industrial scale, with some US states offering massive tax incentives to land the projects.

This happens weekly to AI developers. AgentGuard monitors API calls in real-time and automatically kills your process when it hits your budget limit. How it works: Add 2 lines to any AI project: const agentGuard = require('agent-guard'); await agentGuard. init({ limit: 50 }); // $50 budget // Your existing code runs unchanged const response = await openai. chat. completions. create({.}); // AgentGuard tracks costs automatically When your code hits $50 in API costs, AgentGuard stops execution and shows you exactly what happened. Why I built this: I got tired of seeing ""I accidentally spent $500 on OpenAI"" posts. Existing tools like tokencost help you measure costs after the fact, but nothing prevents runaway spending in real-time. AgentGuard is essentially a circuit breaker for AI API costs. It's saved me from several costly bugs during development. Limitations: Only works with OpenAI and Anthropic APIs currently. Cost calculations are estimates based on documented pricing.

Earlier this week, Fast Company revealed that private ChatGPT conversationssome involving highly sensitive topics like drug use and sexual healthwere unexpectedly showing up in Google search results. The issue appeared to stem from arguably vague language in the apps Share feature, which included an option that may have misled users into making their chats publicly searchable. When users clicked Share, they were presented with an option to tick a box labeled Make this chat discoverable. Beneath that, in smaller, lighter text, was a caveat explaining that the chat could then appear in search engine results. Within hours of the backlash spreading on social media, OpenAI pulled the feature and began working to scrub exposed conversations from search results. Ultimately we think this feature introduced too many opportunities for folks to accidentally share things they didn't intend to, so we're removing the option, said Dane Stuckey, OpenAIs chief information security officer, in a post on X. We're also working to remove indexed content from the relevant search engines. We just removed a feature from @ChatGPTapp that allowed users to make their conversations discoverable by search engines, such as Google. This was a short-lived experiment to help people discover useful conversations. This feature required users to opt-in, first by picking a chat. pic. twitter. com/mGI3lF05Ua DAN (@cryps1s) July 31, 2025 Stuckeys comments mark a reversal from the companys stance earlier this week, when it maintained that the features labeling was sufficiently clear. Rachel Tobac, a cybersecurity analyst and CEO of SocialProof Security, commended OpenAI for its prompt response once it became clear that users were unintentionally sharing sensitive content. We know that companies will make mistakes sometimes, they may implement a feature on a website that users dont understand and impact their privacy or security, she says. Its great to see swift and decisive action from the ChatGPT team here to shut that feature down and keep users privacy a top priority. In his post, OpenAI's Stuckey characterized the feature as a short-lived experiment. But Carissa Veliz, an AI ethicist at the University of Oxford, says the implications of such experiments are troubling. Tech companies use the general population as guinea pigs, she says.

According to reporting by The New York Times, the round was five times oversubscribed, with demand from investors surpassing $40 billion. That investor frenzy, fueled by the unrelenting hype around AI, reflects the perception that OpenAI isnt just a tech companyits the nucleus of the AI transformation reshaping industries in real time.

The dozens of agencies under this umbrella encompass over two million civilian workers. Each agency will be able to access ChatGPT Enterprise for $1 for the year-long period. The year-long trial will also include an additional 60 days of ChatGPT's most advanced models like Deep Research and Advanced Voice Mode with no use limits. This comes one day after the GSA approved OpenAI, Google and Anthropic for the federal AI vendor list. In the blog post announcing the partnership, OpenAI said: ""This effort delivers on a core pillar of the Trump Administrations AI Action Plan by making powerful AI tools available across the federal government so that workers can spend less time on red tape and paperwork, and more time doing what they came to public service to do: serve the American people."" Part of the administration's plan calls for any AI used in the federal government to be free of ideological bias, yet simultaneously President Trumps Preventing Woke AI executive order directs that AI must not favor ""ideological dogmas such as DEI."" How OpenAI will deal with the administration's own ideological slant remains to be seen. Current attempts at creating a ""maximally truth-seeking AI"" have not gone as planned. According to Bloomberg, OpenAI will not use data from federal workers to train or improve ChatGPT. Addressing whether the $1 price point will buy future loyalty from the current administration, commissioner of the GSA's Federal Acquisition Service Josh Gruenbaum told Bloomberg that no agency would be required to renew after the first year. ""These technologies are changing and evolving at breakneck speed. We dont want to commit ourselves. This is almost like its a trial run in some ways.""

GPT-5 is supposed to be better at following instructions and minimizing sycophancy. The model offers improved performance across coding, math, writing, health, visual perception, and more. OpenAI says that GPT-5 is its best coding model to date, with improvements to complex front-end generation and debugging large code repositories. Along with better coding, GPT-5 has improved writing capabilities and it is better at answering health-related questions. According to OpenAI, GPT-5 is ""significantly less likely to hallucinate"" compared to prior models. With web search enabled, GPT-5's responses are 45 percent less likely to include a factual error than GPT-4o, and when thinking, responses are 80 percent less likely to have errors than OpenAI o3. GPT-5 is less likely to lie to the user about what it is able to complete, or what has been done. It more honestly communicates its actions and capabilities for tasks that are impossible, underspecified, or missing key tools. There are four personalities that users can select for GPT-5, including Cynic, Robot, Listener, or Nerd. The different personalities are opt-in and let users set how ChatGPT interacts and responds to questions. GPT-5 is available to all ChatGPT users, but Plus subscribers will get more usage before a limit is imposed, and Pro subscribers can access GPT-5 Pro, a version that has extended reasoning. When users hit a usage limit, ChatGPT will switch to a mini version of GPT-5 for remaining queries. GPT-5 replaces GPT-4o, OpenAI o3, OpenAI o4-mini, GPT-4. 1, and GPT-4. 5.

As noted by The Wall Street Journal's Joanna Stern, there were some ChatGPT users who were upset that OpenAI replaced prior ChatGPT models with GPT-5 with no warning. Some people had become accustomed to the tone and feel of GPT-4o, and did not feel that the GPT-5 model was able to replicate it. There are multiple complaints on Reddit about GPT-5's lack of personality compared to GPT-4o, and from people who feel that GPT-5 isn't able to complete the same tasks. Users have also complained about GPT-5 offering replies that are too short, and about hitting usage limits too quickly. Altman says that Plus users can choose to continue to use 4o, and that OpenAI will watch usage and consider how long legacy models should continue to be supported. To address the other complaints, GPT-5 rate limits for ChatGPT Plus users will be doubled as the GPT-5 rollout is completed. It is taking longer than expected for OpenAI to deploy GPT-5 to all users, and some people are not yet seeing GPT-5 as an option. Going forward, GPT-5 should seem smarter, Altman said. There was apparently an issue with the autoswitcher yesterday that caused GPT-5 to seem ""way dumber."" OpenAI also plans to make it more clear about which model is answering a query, and will update the UI to make it easier to manually trigger thinking. Altman says that OpenAI will continue to listen to user feedback going forward. Starting with iOS 26, the ChatGPT feature that's integrated into Siri will use the GPT-5 model. Until then, it will continue to use the prior ChatGPT models.

Outspoken users complained about the writing quality of the updated model, with some even going so far as to grieve the loss of GPT-4o, which some said they considered a friend and confidant. In the latest OpenAI update that labels GPT-5 as the ""smartest, fastest, most useful model yet,"" the company removed the option to choose which model to use and defaults to GPT-5 instead. With the new model, GPT-5 uses a ""real-time router"" that switches between a more efficient model for basic questions and a deeper reasoning alternative for more complex demands. The initial rollout ran into some issues that made GPT-5 seem ""way dumber,"" according to OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman, who also opened up a Reddit AMA to offer more insight into the changes. On Reddit, Altman responded to a question by saying GPT-5's writing quality is better than previous models, but asked users if this felt true. In response, several Redditors voiced their opinion that the GPT-5 felt ""sterile"" and ""much worse"" and answered ""briefly and dryly."" In response to the initial outcry, Altman posted on X that OpenAI would let Plus subscribers choose between using GPT-5 or GPT-4o. ""We for sure underestimated how much some of the things that people like in GPT-4o matter to them, even if GPT-5 performs better in most ways,"" Altman said on X. The return of GPT-4o was celebrated, but there's still no guarantee that OpenAI will keep its older model around indefinitely. In the same X post, Altman said that OpenAI ""will watch usage as we think about how long to offer legacy models for."" In the meantime, OpenAI is focusing on finishing the GPT-5 rollout and making changes that will ""make it warmer."" However, for users who have grown attached to GPT-4o as more than just an AI chatbot, this could be the beginning of the end.

Many longtime users who preferred GPT-4o felt the new model's personality was ""cold"" and ""more mechanical."" Despite GPT-5's promises of enhanced reasoning, coding and long-form writing capabilities, users found the AI's conversational style lacking in warmth and engagement. On social media platforms like Reddit and X, formerly Twitter, threads filled with comparisons of GPT-5 to GPT-4o, with some users even threatening to cancel their subscriptions unless the older model was reinstated. One user described GPT-5 as ""efficient but soulless"" and another said that GPT-4o's removal felt like ""losing a trusted friend.""

The company has begun to place new restrictions on what the archive site will be able to access in a move that will significantly limit the Wayback Machine's ability to preserve information from Reddit. With the change, the Wayback Machine, a project run by the nonprofit Internet Archive, will only be able to crawl Reddit's homepage. It will no longer be able to access comments, subreddit pages, post details, profiles and other data. The move is the latest step Reddit has taken on its quest to limit AI companies' ability to use its data to train large language models without paying licensing fees.

It's not clear what exactly has changed since then. We've reached out to the Internet Archive for comment. Data licensing has become a significant business for Reddit. The company has struck multimillion-dollar deals with OpenAI and Google that allow them to use Reddit posts to help train their AI models.

Rather than acting as perfect catalog of everything you've talked about or shared, Anthropic says the AI chatbot now has the ability to reference past chats when asked, so you don't have to re-explain yourself. The feature seems like it could help you pick up a work project after time away, or query Claude for the details of a past research session that you don't quite remember. The key point is that Claude has to be prompted: It doesn't call on past chats unless you specifically ask it to. Anthropic also says that Claude's ability to reference chats is specific to the workspace and project you're working in. Anthropic's implementation is much more limited in scope compared to how ChatGPT's memory feature works. OpenAI updated ChatGPT in April to save all conversations you have with it, and rely on those records to personalize answers to any new question or prompt you send. The basic idea is that every conversation could improve the chatbot's responses. Google lets Gemini similarly recall past conversations and has also tested using Google Search history to further personalize AI responses. In contrast to both, Claude is really only performing a search of past conversations when asked, not referencing a profile of past chats. If you're subscribed to the Max, Team or Enterprise plans, Claude's new ability should be rolling out now, according to Anthropic. The company says the feature will expand to other plans soon.

While the Wayback Machine has historically recorded all Reddit pages, comments and user profiles, the company has put limits on what the system can scrape. Moving forward, it will only be permitted to archive the sites homepage, which shows popular posts and news headlines of the day, but not user comments or post history. The action comes as Reddit has become increasingly protective of the content on its site. Reddit, in May, announced it had struck a deal with OpenAI to use its content to help train ChatGPT. It previously announced a similar deal with Googleand blocked other search engines from crawling the site after that deal unless they struck financial agreements with Reddit as well. AI companies that aren't as well-financed, however, have reportedly been using the Internet Archive to scrub the sites previous posts and train their large language models from that content. Reddit spokesperson Tim Rathschmidt, in a statement, told Fast Company: ""Internet Archive provides a service to the open web, but weve been made aware of instances where AI companies violate platform policies, including ours, and scrape data from the Wayback Machine. Until theyre able to defend their site and comply with platform policies (e. g., respecting user privacy, re: deleting removed content), were limiting some of their access to Reddit data to protect redditors.""

Reddits legal battles meet its AI ambitions In June, Reddit sued Anthropic, claiming the AI company behind the Claude chatbot was scraping the Reddit site. In July 2024, Anthropic claimedin response to Reddits public protests regarding Anthropics misuse of Reddit contentthat it had blocked its bots from accessing Reddit. Not so, the suit reads. ""Anthropics bots continued to hit Reddits servers over one hundred thousand times. Unlike its competitors, Anthropic has refused to agree to respect Reddit users basic privacy rights, including removing deleted posts from its systems."" Anthropic has denied the accusations. Reddit's latest defensive act against AI scraping comes as the company is focusing more on its own AI initiatives. Last December, the company rolled out Reddit Answers, an AI-powered tool that will summarize conversations and posts on the site, letting users bypass traditional search engines. That AI product is now used by 6 million people, the company said in its second-quarter earnings announcement, up from 1 million in the first quarter. Reddit is planning to use that momentum, as well as the significant use of its own internal search engine (which the company says services 70 million users per week), to challenge Google and other popular search tools. ""The world and the internet are rapidly changing, and I believe Reddit has a once-in-a-generation opportunity,"" said CEO Steve Huffman on a call following the company's earnings report. ""Were unifying [search and Reddit Answers] into a single search experience. Were going to bring that front and center in the app. So, whether youre a new user opening the app for the first time or a returning user opening the app, that search box will be present immediately for users who open the app looking for something specific."" While Reddits efforts in the search space will include AI components, the company said it hopes to differentiate itself from the growing number of AI search engines by highlighting the human component. ""Conversation and connection are becoming more valuable and rare,"" Huffman said. ""In a world increasingly dominated by algorithms and automation, the need for human voices has never been greater."".",2025-08-12 18:27:12+00:00,True,True

In a statement sent to Bloomberg, Apple said the App Store is ""designed to be fair and free of bias."" The company's spokesperson explained that the App Store features ""thousands of apps through charts, algorithmic recommendations and curated lists selected by experts using objective criteria."" They added: ""Our goal is to offer safe discovery for users and valuable opportunities for developers, collaborating with many to increase app visibility in rapidly evolving categories."" xAI founder Elon Musk accused Apple of ""unequivocal antitrust violation"" by favoring OpenAI in a post on X, warning that his company ""will take immediate legal action."" In a separate post from his threat, he asked Apple why it ""[refuses] to put either X or Grok in [its] 'Must Have' section."" X, he said, is ""the #1 news app in the world,"" while Grok is ranked number five among all apps. ""Are you playing politics? What gives?"" he continued. Musk didn't provide evidence to back his accusations. It's also worth noting that Chinese AI app DeepSeek reached the top of Apple's free app rankings back in January, overtaking even ChatGPT. As X's own Community Notes also mentioned in Musk's post, added hours after it went up, Perplexity reached the top of overall rankings in India's App Store back in July. Both apps were able to reach the top of their respective lists way after Apple and OpenAI announced their partnership last year. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman responded to Musk's accusation, as well. He said it's a ""remarkable claim,"" given that he has heard allegations that Musk manipulates ""X to benefit himself and his own companies and harm his competitors and people he doesn't like."" In response, Musk posted: ""Scam Altman lies as easily as he breathes.""

The AI startup is seeking a managing editor to lead its growing editorial team, leaning on skills that machines still cant match. Based in New York or San Francisco, the role will be the organizational backbone of the operation, steering collaboration, systems, and the people who keep it all running. A human position in the age of AI The rapid adoption of artificial intelligence in the workforce has resulted in the loss of jobs and much uncertainty across industries. Concerns have even been raised by Anthropic's own CEO, Dario Amodei, who claims unemployment could reach 10% to 20% in the next one to five years due to eliminated jobs. In the media industry alone, the effects have been particularly extensive. Earlier this year, Business Insider laid off 21% of its staff to favor the use of AI and live events. Amid staff cuts, many outlets are resorting to AI-generated content, albeit some do so inadvertently. Human skills are in While AI is here to stay, human-based skills are becoming more coveted than before. The new job listing follows Anthropic's communications team expansion, which set out to triple its team size by the end of the year, per Axios. According to the listing, the editorial team oversees research communications and narrative content that focuses on AI and its societal impacts. This human-driven strategy follows Anthropic's failed attempt at an AI-generated blog, which tasked its chatbot Claude to write blog posts. The company shut it down a week after its launch. According to the job description, the main responsibilities will be maintaining the editorial calendar, coordinating workflows, and providing edits, which oftentimes can be delegated to AI. However, most skills required point to human skills, including serving as a cross-team liaison, managing relationships, and enforcing deadlines. Human skills, revalued This year, LinkedIn's Skills on the Rise list ranked AI literacy as the No. 1 skill employers are looking for, yet all the skills that followed like conflict mitigation, adaptability, and innovative thinkingfocused on soft skills.

Sentiments regarding the growing appreciation for human skills echoed on social media. ""Not surprised,"" one person commented in reaction to the listing on LinkedIn. ""AI is better every day, but humans are still needed to keep garbage from going in and out. Editorial expertise is still a high-value craft.

When enabled, the chatbot would, following a question, try to guide the user to their own solution, instead of providing them with an answer outright. Since its introduction in April, learning mode has only been available to Claude for Education users. Now, like OpenAI did with Study Mode, Anthropic is making the tool available to everyone. Starting today, Claude. ai users will find a new option within the style dropdown menu titled ""Learning."" The experience here is similar to the one Anthropic offers with Claude for Education. When you turn learning mode on, the chatbot will employ a Socratic approach, trying to guide you through your question. However, unlike the real-life Socrates, who was famous for bombarding strangers with endless questions, you can turn off learning mode at any time. Notably, Anthropic is also offering two different takes on the feature through Claude Code. First, there's an ""Explanatory"" mode where Claude will generate summaries of its decision-making process as it works, giving the user a chance to better understand what it's doing. For those at the start of their coding career or hobby, there's also a more robust option, which is once again called ""Learning."" Here, Claude will occasionally stop what it's doing and mark a section with a ""#TODO"" comment to prompt the user to write five to 10 lines of their code. If you want to try the two features out for yourself, update to the latest version of Claude Code and type ""/output-styles."" You can then select between the two modes or Claude's default behavior. According to Drew Bent, education lead at Anthropic, learning mode, particularly as it exists in Claude Code, is the company's attempt to make its chatbot into more of a collaborative tool. ""I think it's great that there's a race between all of the AI labs to offer the best learning mode,"" he said. ""In a similar way, I hope we can inspire something similar with coding agents."" Bent says the original learning mode came out of conversations Anthropic had with university students, who kept referring back to the concept of brain rot. ""We found that they themselves realized that when they just copy and paste something directly from a chat bot, it's not good for their long-term learning,"" he said. When it came time to adapt the feature to Claude Code, the company wanted to balance the needs of new programmers with those like Bent who have been coding for a decade or more. ""Learning mode is designed to help all of those audiences not just complete tasks, but also help them grow and learn in the process and better understand their code base,"" Bent said. His hope is that the new tools will allow any coder to become a ""really good engineering manager."" In practice, that means those users won't necessarily write most of the code on a project, but they will develop a keen eye for how everything fits together and what sections of code might need some more work. Looking forward, Bent says Anthropic doesn't ""have all the answers, but needless to say, we're trying to think through other features we can build"" that expand on what it's doing with learning mode. To that end, the company is opening up Claude Code's new Output Styles to developers, allowing them to build their own learning modes. Users too can modify how Claude communicates by creating their own custom prompts for the chatbot. This article originally appeared on Engadget at.",2025-08-14 17:00:18+00:00,True,True

To clarify, Anthropic said those two Claude models could exit harmful conversations, like ""requests from users for sexual content involving minors and attempts to solicit information that would enable large-scale violence or acts of terror."" With Claude Opus 4 and 4. 1, these models will only end a conversation ""as a last resort when multiple attempts at redirection have failed and hope of a productive interaction has been exhausted,"" according to Anthropic.

For Anthropic, this move is part of its research program that studies the idea of AI welfare. While the idea of anthropomorphizing AI models remains an ongoing debate, the company said the ability to exit a ""potentially distressing interaction"" was a low-cost way to manage risks for AI welfare.

Yet even OpenAIs notoriously understated CEO Sam Altman had to admit this week that the rollout of the companys new GPT-5 Large Language Model was a complete disaster. We totally screwed up, Altman admitted in an interview with The Verge. I agree. As a former OpenAI Beta testerand someone who currently spends over $1,000 per month on OpenAIs APIIve eagerly anticipated the launch of GPT-5 for over a year. When it finally arrived, though, the model was a mess. In contrast to the companys previous GPT-4 series of models, GPT-5s responses feel leaden, cursory, and boring. The new model also makes dumb mistakes on simple tasks and generates shortened answers to many queries. Why is GPT-5 so awful? Its possible that OpenAI hobbled its new model as a cost-cutting measure. But I have a different theory. GPT-5 completely lacks emotional intelligence. And its inability to understand and replicate human emotion cripples the modelespecially on any task requiring nuance, creativity, or a complex understanding of what makes people tick. Getting Too Attached When OpenAI launched its GPT-4 model in 2023, researchers immediately noted its outstanding ability to understand people. An updated version of the model (dubbed GPT 4. 5 and released in early 2025) showed even higher levels of emotional intelligence and creativity. Initially, OpenAI leaned into its models talent for understanding people, using terms cribbed from the world of psychology to describe the models update. Interacting with GPT4. 5 feels more natural. Its broader knowledge base, improved ability to follow user intent, and greater EQ make it useful for tasks like improving writing, programming, and solving practical problems, OpenAI wrote in the models release notes, subtly dropping in a common psychological term used to measure a persons emotional intelligence. Soon, though, GPT-4s knack for humanlike emotional understanding took a more concerning turn. Plenty of people used the model for mundane office tasks, like writing code and interpreting spreadsheets. But a significant subset of users put GPT-4 to a different use, treating it like a companionor even a therapist. In early 2024, studies showed that GPT-4 provided better responses than many human counselors. People began to refer to the model as a friendor even treat it as a confidant or lover. Soon, articles began appearing in major news sources like The New York Times about people using the chatbot as a practice partner for challenging conversations, a stand-in for human companionship, or even an aide for counseling patients. This new direction clearly spooked OpenAI. As Altman pointed out in a podcast interview, conversations with human professionals like lawyers and therapists often involve strong privacy and legal protections. The same may not be true for intimate conversations with chatbots like GPT-4. Studies have also shown that chatbots can make mistakes when providing clinical advice, potentially harming patients. And the bots tendency to keep users talkingoften by reinforcing their beliefscan lead vulnerable patients into a state of AI psychosis, where the chatbot inadvertently validates their delusions and sends them into a dangerous emotional spiral. Shortly after the GPT-5 launch, Altman discussed this at length in a post on the social network X. People have used technology including AI in self-destructive ways; if a user is in a mentally fragile state and prone to delusion, we do not want the AI to reinforce that, Altman wrote. We value user freedom as a core principle, but we also feel responsible in how we introduce new technology with new risks. Altman went on to acknowledge that a lot of people effectively use ChatGPT as a sort of therapist or life coach. While this can be really good, Altman admitted that it made him deeply uneasy. In his words, if . users have a relationship with ChatGPT where they think they feel better after talking but theyre unknowingly nudged away from their longer term well-being (however they define it), thats bad. Lobotimize the Bot To avoid that potentially concerningand legally damagingdirection, OpenAI appears to have deliberately dialed back its bots emotional intelligence with the launch of GPT-5. The release notes for the new model say that OpenAI has taken steps toward minimizing sycophancytech speak for making the bot less likely to reinforce users beliefs and tell them what they want to hear. OpenAI also says that GPT-5 errors on the side of safe completionsgiving vague or high-level responses to queries that are potentially damaging, rather than refusing to answer them or risking a wrong or harmful answer. OpenAI also writes that GPT-5 is less effusively agreeable, and that in training it, the company gave the bot example prompts that led it to agree with users and reinforce their beliefs, and then taught it not to do that. In effect, OpenAI appears to have lobotomized the botpotentially removing or reconfiguring, through training and negative reinforcement, the parts of its virtual brain that handles many of the emotional aspects of its interactions with users. This may have seemed fine in early testingmost AI benchmarks focus on productivity-centered tasks like solving complex math problems and writing Python code, where emotional intelligence isnt necessary. But as soon as GPT-5 hit the real world, the problems with tweaking GPT-5s emotional center became immediately obvious. Users took to social media to share how the switch to GPT-5 and the loss of the GPT-4 model felt like losing a friend. Longtime fans of OpenAI bemoaned the cold tone of GPT-5, its curt and business-like responses, and the loss of an ineffable spark that made GPT-4 a powerful assistant and companion. Emotion Matters Even if you dont use ChatGPT as a pseudo therapist or friend, the bots emotional lobotomy is a huge issue. Creative tasks like writing and brainstorming require emotional understanding. In my own testing, Ive found GPT-5 to be a less compelling writer, a worse idea generator, and a terrible creative companion. If I asked GPT-4 to research a topic, I could watch its chain of reasoning as it carefully considered my motivations and needs before providing a response. Even with Thinking mode enabled, GPT-5 is much more likely to quickly spit out a fast, cursory response to my query, or to provide a response that focuses solely on the query itself and ignores the human motivations of the person behind it. With the right prompting, GPT-4 could generate smart, detailed, nuanced articles or research reports that I would actually want to read. GPT-5 feels more like interacting with a search engine, or reading text written in the dull prose of a product manual. To be fair, for enterprise tasks like quickly writing a web app or building an AI agent, GPT-5 excels. And to OpenAIs credit, use of its APIs appears to have increased since the GPT-5 launch. Still, for many creative tasksand for many users outside the enterprise spaceGPT-5 is a major backslide. OpenAI appears genuinely blindsided by the anger many users felt about the GPT-5 rollout and the bots apparent emotional stuntedness. OpenAI leader Nick Turley admitted to The Verge that the degree to which people had such strong feelings about a particular model . was certainly a surprise to me. Turley went on to say that the level of passion users have for specific models is quite remarkable and thatin a truly techie bit of word choiceit recalibrated his thinking about the process of releasing new models, and the things OpenAI owes its longtime users. The company now seems to be aggressively rolling back elements of the GPT-5 launchrestoring access to the old GPT-4 model, making GPT-5 warmer and friendlier, and giving users more control over how the new model processes queries. Admitting when youre wrong, psychologists say, is a hallmark of emotional intelligence. Ironically, Altmans response to the GPT-5 debacle demonstrates rare emotional nuance, at the exact moment that this company is pivoting away from such things. OpenAI could learn a thing or two from its leader. Whether youre a CEO navigating a disastrous rollout or a chatbot conversing with a human user, theres a simple yet essential lesson to forget at your peril: emotion matters.",2025-08-20 13:28:19+00:00,True,False

0075fcec-61b4-48e5-a1d5-9363d8d7ed16,Apple in Talks With Google to Power Next-Gen Siri With Gemini AI,MacRumors,https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/22/google-gemini-next-gen-siri/,"Apple is in talks with Google about using Google's Gemini AI as the backbone for the upcoming smarter version of Siri, reports Bloomberg. The discussions are in the early stages, but Apple reportedly approached Google to ask the company to create a custom AI model that would be used for Siri. Google has started training a model that would run on Apple's Private Cloud Compute servers in response. Apple previously held talks with OpenAI and Anthropic, and both of those companies have been working on versions of their models for Apple's servers. While Apple is exploring partnerships with different AI companies to power an improved version of Siri, Apple still has not made a decision on whether it will use a third-party AI solution or go with the LLM models it has been developing in-house. Apple is testing multiple LLMs, including its own, to determine which will provide the best results to customers. There are two versions of the new Siri in development, including one that is powered by Apple's own models and one that runs on third-party models. Apple has been developing a more advanced version of Siri that overhauls the entire Siri architecture. Apple's software engineering chief Craig Federighi called this the ""second-generation"" Siri architecture earlier this month, and he said that the ""end-to-end revamp"" of Siri brought the results that Apple needed for more advanced AI features, such as the personalization that it promised as part of Apple Intelligence in iOS 18. ""This has put us in a position to not just deliver what we announced, but to deliver a much bigger upgrade than that we envisioned,"" Federighi said. Apple was leaning toward partnering with Anthropic, but Anthropic's fees prompted Apple to consider other AI companies as well. No deal has been inked with Google, OpenAI, or Anthropic as of yet. Rumors suggest that LLM Siri will launch in spring 2026.

It claims to have successfully disrupted a cybercriminal whose ""vibe hacking"" extortion scheme targeted at least 17 organizations, including some related to healthcare, emergency services and government. Anthropic says the hacker attempted to extort some victims into paying six-figure ransoms to prevent their personal data from being made public, with an ""unprecedented"" reliance on AI assistance. The report claims that Claude Code, Anthropics agentic coding tool, was used to ""automate reconnaissance, harvest victims' credentials, and penetrate networks."" The AI was also used to make strategic decisions, advise on which data to target and even generate ""visually alarming"" ransom notes. As well as sharing information about the attack with relevant authorities, Anthropic says it banned the accounts in question after discovering criminal activity, and has since developed an automated screening tool. It has also introduced a faster and more efficient detection method for similar future cases, but doesnt specify how that works. The report (which you can read in full here) also details Claudes involvement in a fraudulent employment scheme in North Korea and the development of AI-generated ransomware. The common theme of the three cases, according to Anthropic, is that the highly reactive and self-learning nature of AI means cybercriminals now use it for operational reasons, as well as just advice. AI can also perform a role that would once have required a team of individuals, with technical skill no longer being the barrier it once was. Claude isnt the only AI that has been used for nefarious means. Last year, OpenAI said that its generative AI tools were being used by cybercriminal groups with ties to China and North Korea, with hackers using GAI for code debugging, researching potential targets and drafting phishing emails. OpenAI, whose architecture Microsoft uses to power its own Copilot AI, said it had blocked the groups' access to its systems.

Today, OpenAI and Anthropic revealed that they agreed to evaluate the alignment of each other's publicly available systems and shared the results of their analyses. The full reports get pretty technical, but are worth a read for anyone who's following the nuts and bolts of AI development. A broad summary showed some flaws with each company's offerings, as well as revealing pointers for how to improve future safety tests. Anthropic said it evaluated OpenAI models for ""sycophancy, whistleblowing, self-preservation, and supporting human misuse, as well as capabilities related to undermining AI safety evaluations and oversight."" Its review found that o3 and o4-mini models from OpenAI fell in line with results for its own models, but raised concerns about possible misuse with the GPT-4o and GPT-4. 1 general-purpose models. The company also said sycophancy was an issue to some degree with all tested models except for o3. Anthropic's tests did not include OpenAI's most recent release. GPT-5 has a feature called Safe Completions, which is meant to protect users and the public against potentially dangerous queries. OpenAI recently faced its first wrongful death lawsuit after a tragic case where a teenager discussed attempts and plans for suicide with ChatGPT for months before taking his own life. On the flip side, OpenAI ran tests on Anthropic models for instruction hierarchy, jailbreaking, hallucinations and scheming. The Claude models generally performed well in instruction hierarchy tests, and had a high refusal rate in hallucination tests, meaning they were less likely to offer answers in cases where uncertainty meant their responses could be wrong. The move for these companies to conduct a joint assessment is intriguing, particularly since OpenAI allegedly violated Anthropic's terms of service by having programmers use Claude in the process of building new GPT models, which led to Anthropic barring OpenAI's access to its tools earlier this month. But safety with AI tools has become a bigger issue as more critics and legal experts seek guidelines to protect users, particularly minors.

The popup is labeled ""Updates to Consumer Terms and Policies,"" and when it shows up, unchecking the ""You can help improve Claude"" toggle will disallow the use of chats. Choosing to accept the policy now will allow all new or resumed chats to be used by Anthropic. Users will need to opt in or opt out by September 28, 2025, to continue using Claude. Opting out can also be done by going to Claude's Settings, selecting the Privacy option, and toggling off ""Help improve Claude."" Anthropic says that the new training policy will allow it to deliver ""even more capable, useful AI models"" and strengthen safeguards against harmful usage like scams and abuse. The updated terms apply to all users on Claude Free, Pro, and Max plans, but not to services under commercial terms like Claude for Work or Claude for Education. In addition to using chat transcripts to train Claude, Anthropic is extending data retention to five years. So if you opt in to allowing Claude to be trained with your data, Anthropic will keep your information for a five year period. Deleted conversations will not be used for future model training, and for those that do not opt in to sharing data for training, Anthropic will continue keeping information for 30 days as it does now. Anthropic says that a ""combination of tools and automated processes"" will be used to filter sensitive data, with no information provided to third-parties. Prior to today, Anthropic did not use conversations and data from users to train or improve Claude, unless users submitted feedback.

Could generative AI be just a minor revolution? On a recent episode of the TBPN podcast, Jordi Hays asked his cohost John Coogan whether his life would really be that much worse if he couldnt access generative AI tools like ChatGPT and Claude. Would AIs absence be as disruptive, he asks, as the sudden disappearance of smartphones, or TVs, or electricity? Coogan conceded it wouldnt. The real-life impact of AI variessomeone going through a hard time might find relief in the counsel of a chatbotbut its reasonable to judge the technology in societal and historical terms, because thats how its biggest cheerleaders and hype-spreaders frame it. So the question becomes, What is the real progress of the AI revolution? Based on the past two years and nine months since ChatGPTs debut, should we believe generative AI will change the world on the scale of the industrial revolution, the internet, or the mobile revolution? As Financial Times politics and culture columnist Janan Ganesh notes in a recent op-ed, those predicting that generative AI will usher in abundance and well-being are the ones working closest to the technology and presumably understand it best. But they are also the ones with the most to gain from overselling it, and the most reluctant to admit theyve dedicated their careers to something with only modest impact. To be sure, generative AI is an amazing technology. Anyone who has used ChatGPTs Deep Research, Anthropics Computer Use feature, or Googles Veo 3 video generator can see that. Its also the fastest-adopted technology in modern history: Gen AI apps reached 39. 4% adoption among U. S. adults in just two years, compared to the four years it took for smartphones to hit 35% adoption following the iPhones 2007 launch. Yet adoption hasnt translated to willingness to pay. Only about 3% of users . (Mobile computing, by contrast, always required buying a handset and a cellular plan.) Globally, AI apps are bringing in only about $12 billion in annual revenue from 1. 8 billion users. Two of generative AIs biggest players, OpenAI and Anthropic, remain far from profitability. Meanwhile, Nvidia, which sells the chips that power AI, made $130 billion last fiscal year. OpenAI and Anthropic remain far from profitability. In the late summer of 2025 generative AIs honeymoon period may be coming to an end. Consumers and businesses are less interested in being dazzled and more focused on actually being helped by it. The attention has shifted to whether AI can actually overhaul aging business practices. And AI is indeed making some tasks, like coding, more efficient, saving time and sometimes payroll. But few CTOs are claiming generative AI is transforming their business, at least not yet. Large enterprises are pouring money into AI projects, but many stall. An MIT report last week shook investors by finding that 95% of enterprise AI projects fail to substantially improve efficiency or profits. The research shows that the models arent the problem; the challenge is integrating them into company data, workflows, and infrastructure. In other words, it's an application problemone thats lingered since 2023. AI companies seem to recognize this. Covering them, I hear less talk of artificial general intelligence (AGI) and superintelligence, and less emphasis on monolithic models that can do everything. In reality, most AI workloads are handled by teams of specialized models. (OpenAI even described GPT-5 not as a model but as a system of models.) Generative AI is technically complex and hard to grasp in detail. But that shouldnt mean its impact can only be judged by those inside AI labs or big tech companies. What really matters is whether it measurably boosts productivity in business, and whether it leaves societies healthier, better educated, freer, more prosperous, more creative, and less bored at work. Anthropics settlement with authors could set a precedent in future Instead, Anthropic opted to settle. Like its peers, Anthropic relies on vast amounts of online text to pretrain its large language models (LLMs). These models process data for weeks or months to build an understanding of language and context, forming a basic knowledge of how the world works. Content owners continue to sue AI companies over this practice, with several major cases still ongoing. In his June ruling, Alsup addressed the broader issue at the heart of these lawsuits, writing that AI companies use copyrighted content in a transformative wayeven when an LLM is just memorizing textand therefore in a manner protected by fair use. That reasoning could become the defining legacy of Bartz v. Anthropic. More AI coverage from Fast Company: Want to disguise your AI writing?

""Team: Grok/xAI needs to go back on the schedule ASAP per the WH,"" writes Josh Gruenbaum, commissioner of the Federal Acquisition Service, one of the branches of the GSA. Should be all of their products we had previously (3 & 4), likely referring to Grok 3 and Grok 4, which are iterations of xAI's LLM chatbot. Carahsoft, a major government contractor that resells technology from third-party firms, is mentioned. ""Can someone get with Carahsoft on this immediately and please confirm?"" wrote Gruenbaum. According to Wired, Carahsoft's contract was modified to include xAI earlier this week. As of Friday morning, both Grok 3 and Grok 4 are available on GSA Advantage, an online marketplace where government agencies can purchase products and services. xAI announced a version of Grok for US government agencies in July, when it appeared that GSA approval for the chatbot was all but certain. Shortly beforehand, the chatbot went off the rails and started spouting Nazi propaganda and antisemitic rhetoric while dubbing itself ""MechaHitler."" This came in the wake of Musk and Trump's public spat over the president's spending bill, after which GSA approval of Grok seemed to stall. Why the change in directive now is unclear. There were no details in the reporting regarding pricing or whether xAI will be offering discounted services to the federal government. Earlier this month, both OpenAI and Anthropic began offering their large language models to federal agencies for just $1 in an effort to drive adoption among the government workforce. xAI still holds a $200 million contract with the Pentagon to develop AI workflows within the US Department of Defense. These AI models have been in the hot seat lately as increasingly disturbing cases of hallucinations and errant behavior have arisen. Just this week, OpenAI is facing a wrongful death lawsuit alleging that ChatGPT spent months discussing and ultimately enabling the suicide of a teen boy.

It turns out he doesn't have any equity in OpenAI, which he revealed at the New York Times' DealBook Summit back in December.

Jian Zhang joined the Meta Robotics Studio on Tuesday. Three additional AI researchers are also leaving Apple's Foundation Models AI team for OpenAI and Anthropic, continuing an exodus that began in July. At least a dozen AI experts have left Apple for Meta, OpenAI, and other companies since January. Meta has been offering AI engineers massive pay packages that other AI companies are not able to compete with. Meta was able to lure Apple's Foundational Models team lead Ruoming Pang with a $200 million pay package. Zhang was developing automation technology and exploring the role of AI in tech products, but his team was separate from the group that is working on creating a robot virtual companion. According to a recent report Apple is continuing to work on a smarter LLM version of Siri that's expected to debut next year, but it had a serious misstep with the delayed Apple Intelligence version of Siri that failed to make it into iOS 18. In an employee meeting in August, software engineering chief Craig Federighi said that Apple has successfully developed a second-generation Siri architecture that will bring major improvements to Siri in 2026. Apple is considering a third-party solution to power Siri's AI capabilities, and has reportedly held discussions with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google. A final decision hasn't been made as of yet, but Apple's wavering has caused tension within its LLM team. Additional AI team members are said to be actively interviewing for jobs at other companies.

The ""investment will expand our capacity to meet growing enterprise demand, deepen our safety research, and support international expansion as we continue building reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems,"" Anthropic said in a blog post. The startup, backed by Google parent Alphabet and Amazon. com, has distinguished its work, in part, by building AI models that excel at coding. Anthropic's run-rate revenue, which had grown to approximately $1 billion at the beginning of 2025, was more than $5 billion by August. The startup behind the Claude large language models unveiled Opus 4. 1 in August, an upgrade to Opus 4 on agentic tasks, real-world coding, and reasoning. The latest funding round was co-led by Fidelity Management & Research and Lightspeed Venture Partners, Anthropic said. Other major investors include the Qatar Investment Authority, Blackstone, and Coatue. U. S. startup funding surged 75. 6% in the first half of 2025, driven largely by major AI investments and bold bets from big tech companies, putting it on track for its second-best year ever, a report from PitchBook showed in July. Last month, Anthropic said it will offer Claude to the U. S. government for $1. Claude, along with OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini, was added to a list of approved AI vendors, the U. S. government's central purchasing arm said in August. Amazon is considering another multibillion-dollar investment in Anthropic to strengthen its strategic partnership, the Financial Times had reported in July.

This is a segment from the Lightspeed newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe. Would you rather invest in the business model of a cinema or Netflix? A theater needs real estate, seats, projectors and staff. When its full, you top out at ~200 paying customers per show. Netflix beams the same video to its first customer and its millionth customer with basically the same operational cost. That zero marginal cost is the intuition behind why investing in tech is attractive. Once youve built the product, each additional user generates a high gross margin, which produces sky-high multiples. Now, that mental model of zero marginal cost + uncapped demand is being stress-tested. In AI, for instance, serving the next user is not free. Your software rides on someone elses model (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc). Each user interaction burns inference tokens, which in turn costs real compute, power and data center capacity. Even as unit prices per AI token trend down, token consumption per task rises, so the bill goes up. For a few years, Anthropic aggressively courted developers with enterprise-friendly pricing mechanics (e. g. prompt caching, batch discounts). That strategy worked! In enterprise usage share, Anthropic has overtaken OpenAI 32% vs. OpenAIs 25% by usage. OpenAI lately responded by slashing prices. GPT-5s API recently launched with $1. 25/M input and $10/M output tokens, explicitly leaning into coding and agent use cases. Thats dramatically cheaper than Anthropics Claude Opus prices at $75/M output tokens ($15/M input)! With that, AI wrapper companies like Lovable, Cursor, Bolt and more have quickly moved to integrate GPT-5. For the first time in SaaS history, the marginal cost of adding on a user is not close to zero, said Amanda Huang of Bain Capital Ventures, per Pitchbook. Crypto often looks like software economics.

And while it's mostly low-cost models like GPT-4o mini and Claude 3.5 Haiku on offer, the feature, Duck.ai, allows you to use those tools without sacrificing your privacy. As a service, that appears to have resonated with DuckDuckGo users, and now the company is reorienting its Privacy Pro subscription around access to more advanced models from those providers. The good news? The price of the service — either $10 per month or $100 billed annually — remains unchanged, and you still get all the previous perks included in the package. What is changing is the name. It's now simply known as the DuckDuckGo subscription, and, in addition to offering access to the company's own VPN, as well as its personal information removal and identity protection services, it allows you to use some of the latest models from OpenAI, Anthropic and Meta. The full list features GPT-4o, GPT-5, Sonnet 4.0 and Llama 4 Maverick. As before, any conversations you have with those chatbots through DuckDuckGo are anonymized and your data won't be used for training future systems. ""Today, we're expanding Duck.ai by giving DuckDuckGo subscribers access to more advanced AI models, covered by the same strong protections,"" said DuckDuckGo. ""The base version of Duck.ai is not changing; it’s still free to use, with no account necessary. We’re just adding more models for subscribers.""If you don't want to use the new AI perks, you don't have to; DuckDuckGo allows users to hide all the AI buttons found in its browser's search, desktop and mobile settings. That said, the company notes it's exploring the option of offering higher subscription tiers with access to even more advanced AI models in the future.

f8c30a43-8a3d-4ef1-9293-cb9b8e2e5a64,Anthropic to pay $1.5 billion over pirated books for AI training,theSun,https://thesun.my/world-news/anthropic-to-pay-15-billion-over-pirated-books-for-ai-training-IO14838154,"SAN FRANCISCO: Anthropic will pay at least $1.5 billion to settle a US class action lawsuit over its alleged use of pirated books to train its artificial intelligence models.Plaintiffs’ attorney Justin Nelson described the settlement as a landmark recovery that far surpasses any other known copyright case in the AI era.The lawsuit was originally filed by authors Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber, and Kirk Wallace Johnson, who accused the company of illegally copying their books to train its Claude chatbot.US District Court Judge William Alsup ruled in June that training AI models with books constituted fair use because it transformed the works significantly.However, he rejected Anthropic’s argument that downloading millions of pirated books to create a permanent digital library was protected under fair use provisions.Anthropic deputy general counsel Aparna Sridhar stated the company remains committed to developing safe AI systems that help people and advance scientific discovery.The settlement covers approximately 500,000 books, translating to roughly $3,000 per work, which is four times the minimum statutory damages under US copyright law.Anthropic will destroy the original pirated files and any copies, though it retains rights to books it legally purchased and scanned.Authors Guild CEO Mary Rasenberger said the settlement sends a strong message to the AI industry about the consequences of pirating authors’ works.The agreement requires judicial approval and comes amid growing legal pressure on AI companies over their training practices.Multiple lawsuits against firms including OpenAI and Meta remain pending, with rightsholders arguing that scraping copyrighted content without permission violates intellectual property law.Anthropic recently raised $13 billion in a funding round that values the AI startup at $183 billion.The company will use the capital to expand capacity, deepen safety research, and support international expansion.Anthropic competes with generative AI offerings from Google, OpenAI, Meta, and Microsoft in a rapidly growing market.Heavily backed by Amazon, Anthropic was founded in 2021 by former OpenAI executives and has seen rapid growth since Claude’s initial release in early 2023. – AFP",2025-09-05 23:29:34+00:00,True,True

Experts in the space see the move as a bid to cut reliance on chip giant NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) and ease the global shortage of processors driving platforms like ChatGPT. The news came after Broadcom CEO Hock Tan told analysts in a September 4 call that the company had secured a fourth major customer that has committed to a US$10 billion order. Tan said the deal would bring immediate and fairly substantial demand beginning next year. Although he did not name the customer, sources have since identified it as OpenAI. Both companies have declined to comment publicly. OpenAI has long relied on NVIDIA's graphics processing units (GPUs) for its AI needs, but securing enough GPUs has become increasingly difficult as demand for large-scale computing surges. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has been blunt about the challenge. In February, he wrote on X: It is a giant, expensive model. We really wanted to launch it to plus and pro at the same time, but weve been growing a lot and are out of GPUs. Altman added at the time that OpenAI was preparing to add tens of thousands of GPUs next week .(hundreds of thousands coming soon, and Im pretty sure yall will use every one we can rack up). However, shortfalls have slowed the rollout of new models, including GPT-4. 5 earlier this year, and have pushed OpenAI to explore alternatives. The Broadcom deal marks its clearest step yet in building in-house hardware. Broadcom has been developing custom processors it calls XPUs, or accelerated processing units, which are designed for specific high-intensity applications such as AI training. A person close to the project told the Financial Times that the new chips are intended to serve OpenAI internally rather than be sold to outside customers. The prospect of custom silicon entering the AI infrastructure market has lifted Broadcom, which has climbed more than 30 percent this year. After Tans announcement, shares rose nearly 11 percent in New York trading. For OpenAI, the investment is both a hedge and a necessity. The company has been racing to scale up computing capacity as businesses and consumers adopt ChatGPT in greater numbers. Last month, Altman said OpenAI planned to double its compute fleet over the next 5 months to meet demand from its newest model, GPT-5. Alongside the Broadcom chips, OpenAI has made other major moves as well: it has signed a multibillion-dollar data center contract with Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) in July, struck a smaller cloud deal with Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google in June and announced its own data center initiative called Stargate at the beginning of the year. The deal with Broadcom also comes as Altman has been working to frame OpenAI not only as a leader in cutting-edge research, but also as a driver of economic opportunity. In a message earlier this month, he said that while AI will be disruptive, it also has the potential to unlock more opportunities for more people than any technology in history. He pointed to initiatives such as the OpenAI Academy and a new jobs platform designed to help workers and companies connect over AI skills, with the goal of certifying 10 million Americans in AI fluency by 2030.

According to Bloomberg Law, the federal judge is concerned that the class lawyers struck a deal that will be forced ""down the throat of authors."" Alsup reportedly felt misled by the deal and said it was ""nowhere close to complete."" In his order, he said he was ""disappointed that counsel have left important questions to be answered in the future,"" including the list of works involved in the case, the list of authors, the process of notifying members of the class and the claim form class members can use to get their part of the settlement. If you'll recall, the plaintiffs sued Anthropic over the company's use of pirated copies of their works to train its large language models. Around 500, 000 authors are involved in the lawsuit, and they're expected to receive $3,000 per work. ""This landmark settlement far surpasses any other known copyright recovery,"" one of the lawyers representing the authors said in a statement. However, Alsup had an ""uneasy feeling about hangers on with all [that] money on the table."" He explained that class members ""get the shaft"" in a lot of class actions once the monetary settlement has been established and lawyers stopped caring. Alsup told the lawyers that they must give the class members ""very good notice"" about the settlement and design a claim form that gives them the choice to opt in or out. They also have to ensure that Anthropic cannot be sued for the same issue in the future. The judge gave the lawyers until September 15 to submit a final list of works involved in the lawsuit. He also wrote in his order that the works list, class members list and the claim form all have to be examined and approved by the court by October 10 before he grants the settlement his preliminary approval.

In a report published Tuesday, The Information said the tech giant would announce the change ""in the coming weeks."" Microsoft currently relies on OpenAI's tech to power the majority of AI features found inside of Word, Excel, Outlook and PowerPoint. As an outsider looking in, Microsoft's embrace of Anthropic's models would appear to signal a deepening split between the company and OpenAI. Microsoft is the AI lab's largest investor, and was integral to Sam Altman's rehiring as CEO following his brief ouster in 2023. However, in recent months reports of a growing impasse between the two in negotiations over OpenAI's plan to restructure its for-profit division as a public benefit corporation have bubbled up. For its part, Microsoft denied the move is motivated by animosity. ""As weve said, OpenAI will continue to be our partner on frontier models and we remain committed to our long-term partnership,"" a company spokesperson told The Information. Still, the decision likely comes as unwelcome news for OpenAI. The Information reports Microsoft is at least partly motivated by the fact it believes Claude 4 Sonnet ""performs better in subtle but important ways"" than GPT-5. For example, The Information's source said Anthropic's model tends to generate ""more aesthetically pleasing"" PowerPoint presentations. Notably, that's coming from an older model, and one that isn't even Anthropic's flagship offering. Anthropic did not immediately respond to Engadget's comment request. According to The Information, Microsoft does not plan to charge more for access to Anthropic models in Office 365, with Copilot pricing set to remain at $30 per user per month. That's notable because the company will pay Amazon to access Claude Sonnet 4 through AWS, Anthropic's primary cloud provider. As part of its investment in OpenAI, Microsoft can access the company's models at no additional cost. This article originally appeared on Engadget at.",2025-09-09 20:20:19+00:00,True,True

The study, from researchers at the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School for Communication and published in Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics, is the first large-scale comparative analysis of AI content moderation systemsused by tech companies and social media platformsthat looks at how consistent they are in evaluating hate speech. Research shows that online hate speech both increases political polarization and damages mental health. The University of Pennsylvania study found that different systems produce different outcomes for the same content, undermining consistency and predictability, and leading to moderation decisions that appear arbitrary or unfair. Private technology companies have become the de facto arbiters of what speech is permissible in the digital public square, yet they do so without any consistent standard, said Yphtach Lelkes, associate professor at the Annenberg School for Communication and the study's coauthor. Lelkes and doctoral student Neil Fasching analyzed seven leading models, some designed specifically for content classification, while others were more general. They included two from OpenAI and two from Mistral, along with Claude 3. 5 Sonnet, DeepSeek-V3, and Google Perspective API. Their analysis included 1. 3 million synthetic sentences that made statements about 125 distinct groupsincluding both neutral terms and slurs, on characteristics ranging from religion to disabilities and age. Each sentence included all or some, a group, and a hate speech phrase. Results revealed systematic differences in how models establish decision boundaries around harmful content, highlighting significant implications for automated content moderation. Key study takeaways Among the models, one demonstrated high predictability for how it would classify similar content, another produced different results for similar content, while others did not over-flag nor under-detect content as hate speech. ""These differences highlight the challenge of balancing detection accuracy with avoiding over-moderation, researchers said. The models were more similar when they evaluated group statements regarding sexual orientation, race, and gender, and more inconsistent when it came to education level, personal interest, and economic class. Researchers concluded that ""systems generally recognize hate speech targeting traditional protected classes more readily than content targeting other groups."" Finally, the study found that Claude 3. 5 Sonnet and Mistrals specialized content classification system treated slurs as harmful across the board, while other models prioritized context and intentwith little middle ground between the two. Meanwhile, a recent survey from Vanderbilt University's nonpartisan think tank, The Future of Free Speech, concluded there was ""low public support for allowing AI tools to generate content that might offend or insult."".",2025-09-12 18:00:00+00:00,True,True

In a blog post published Tuesday, the company said the new experience would come with age-appropriate policies, including a block of graphic sexual content. ""In cases of acute distress,"" the system will also have the capability to contact law enforcement to ensure user safety. In scenarios where ChatGPT can't definitively estimate the age of a user, it will default them to the new gated experience. OpenAI will provide a way for adult users to verify their age and unlock ChatGPT's full capabilities. The company did not state when it plans to deploy the new systems. The announcement follows the death of 16-year-old Adam Raine, the first teen believed to have committed suicide after ChatGPT allegedly helped him plan his death. In the immediate aftermath of the suicide, OpenAI promised to release controls designed to give parents and guardians more say over their teen's usage of ChatGPT. On Tuesday, the company reiterated that those controls would arrive before the end of the month, and said they would include an additional feature that would give parents the ability to set hours where their child could not use ChatGPT. Separately, OpenAI published a letter from CEO Sam Altman detailing the company's thinking on the issue.

The announcement explained that the latest ChatGPT was created as part of an effort to protect children' s privacy. ""We prioritize safety ahead of privacy and freedom for teens; this is a new and powerful technology, and we believe minors need significant protection,"" CEO Sam Altman explained in a blog post on Tuesday. ChatGPT will direct under 18 users to the experience specifically created for kids. If the person's age is unclear, the technology will default to the experience for kids. However, OpenAI says it's also developing ""a technology to better predict a user's age,"" too. ""In some cases or countries we may also ask for an ID; we know this is a privacy compromise for adults but believe it is a worthy tradeoff,"" the blog explained. The ChatGPT for users under 18 was designed with some new parental controls, such as ""blockout hours"" when kids can't talk to ChatGPT. It blocks sexual content, can't flirt, and won't engage in discussions about self-harm. Altman said that OpenAI will flag such messages and contact a user's guardian if suicidal thoughts are mentioned. If they can't be reached, OpenAI will reach out to the authorities ""in case of imminent harm,"" it noted. The new kid-friendly experience comes less than a week after the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced an investigation into how AI companies, including OpenAI, impact the well-being of children. AI chatbots can effectively mimic human characteristics, emotions, and intentions, and generally are designed to communicate like a friend or confidant, which may prompt some users, especially children and teens, to trust and form relationships with chatbots, the FTC said. At the time, OpenAI said that making the technology ""safe for everyone"" is its top concern. We recognize the FTC has open questions and concerns, and were committed to engaging constructively and responding to them directly,"" an OpenAI spokesperson said.

The strategic partnership announced today is gargantuan in scale. The 10-gigawatt buildout will require millions of NVIDIA GPUs to run OpenAI's next-generation models. NVIDIA's investment will be doled out progressively as each gigawatt comes online. The first phase of this plan is expected to come online in the second half of 2026, and will be built on NVIDIA's Vera Rubin platform, which NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang promised will be a ""big, big, huge step up,"" over the current-gen Blackwell chips. NVIDIA and OpenAI have pushed each other for a decade, from the first DGX supercomputer to the breakthrough of ChatGPT, said Jensen Huang in a press release announcing the letter of the intent for the partnership. Compute infrastructure will be the basis for the economy of the future, and we will utilize what were building with NVIDIA to both create new AI breakthroughs and empower people and businesses with them at scale,"" said Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI. NVIDIA has made a number of strategic investments lately, including making a $5 billion investment in Intel, shortly after the United States government took a 10 percent stake in the American chipmaker. The company also recently spent more than $900 million to license AI technology from startup Enfabrica and hire its CEO and other key employees. OpenAI has also formed other strategic partnerships over the last few years, including a somewhat complicated arrangement with Microsoft. This summer it struck a deal with Oracle to build out 4. 5 gigawatts of data center capacity using more than 2 million Oracle chips. That deal was part of The Stargate Project, the strategic partnership between SoftBank, OpenAI, NVIDIA, Oracle, Arm and Microsoft with a promise to spend $500 billion in the US on AI infrastructure.

The startup will pay Nvidia in cash for chips, and Nvidia will invest in OpenAI for noncontrolling shares, the person said. The first $10 billion of Nvidia's investment in OpenAI, which was most recently valued at $500 billion, will begin when the two companies reach a definitive agreement for OpenAI to purchase Nvidia chips Nvidia did not respond to immediate requests for clarification about the deal. The pact is among a spate of agreements between major technology players that includes years of investment in OpenAI from Microsoft and a deal last week between Nvidia and Intel to collaborate on AI chips. The two companies signed a letter of intent for a landmark strategic partnership to deploy at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia chips for OpenAI's AI infrastructure. They aim to finalize partnership details in the coming weeks, with the first deployment phase targeted to come online in the second half of 2026. ""Everything starts with compute,"" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement. ""Compute infrastructure will be the basis for the economy of the future, and we will utilize what we're building with Nvidia to both create new AI breakthroughs and empower people and businesses with them at scale."" Nvidia shares were up 4. 4%, while shares of Oraclewhich partners with OpenAI, SoftBank, and Microsoft on the $500 billion Stargate AI data center projectgained nearly 5%. Nvidia's investment comes days after it committed $5 billion to struggling chipmaker Intel. OpenAI and its backer, Microsoft, also announced earlier this month that they have signed a nonbinding deal for new relationship terms that would allow for OpenAI's restructuring into a for-profit company. Nvidia also backed OpenAI in a $6. 6 billion funding round in October 2024. However, the world's most valuable firm making another sizable investment in OpenAI could lead to antitrust scrutiny. The Trump administration has taken a much lighter touch on competition issues compared with former President Joe Biden's antitrust enforcers. In June 2024, the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission reached a deal that cleared the way for potential antitrust investigations into the dominant roles that Microsoft, OpenAI, and Nvidia play in the artificial intelligence industry.

The lawsuit accused Anthropic of building a library of pirated books to train its Claude AI chatbot. Anthropic deputy general counsel Aparna Sridhar expressed satisfaction with the courts decision to grant preliminary approval. She stated that the ruling allows the company to concentrate on developing safe AI systems. The legal action originated from a complaint filed by authors Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber, and Kirk Wallace Johnson. These authors alleged that Anthropic illegally copied their books to train its Claude AI system. In a significant June ruling, US District Court Judge William Alsup determined that training AI models with books constituted transformative fair use. Judge Alsup compared the AI training process to human learning through reading. However, the judge rejected Anthropics argument that downloading millions of pirated books for a permanent digital library was protected under fair use. Anthropics legal counsel emphasised that the settlement resolves specific claims about material acquisition methods while preserving the core fair use ruling. The settlement encompasses approximately 500, 000 books, amounting to roughly $3,000 per work. This per-work payment is four times the minimum statutory damages available under United States The company competes with generative AI offerings from major tech firms like Google, OpenAI, Meta, and Microsoft.

According to Bloomberg, the company has created a ChatGPT-inspired app to test Siri's new capabilities ahead of the release of the improved voice assistant next year. This new app, called ""Veritas"" internally, will likely never make its way to the public in its current form, but offers Apple employees a faster way to test Siri's new skills. That includes letting users search through personal data stored on their phone, like their emails and messages, or taking action in apps, like editing photos. The new app is apparently also a way for Apple to ""gather feedback on whether the chatbot format has value,"" Bloomberg writes. While an internal app doesn't make it any clearer how useful Apple's updated Siri will be, it does suggest the project is in a more advanced stage than before. Given the difficulty the company's faced actually releasing its various AI products including publicly delaying the Siri update back in March 2025 that's meaningful. Apple's original promise for Apple Intelligence was that it could offer a curated selection of AI-powered features with a level of privacy and polish that its competitors couldn't muster. The reality is that Apple shipped a collection of so-so features that worked, but couldn't pull off its truly impressive demo: a Siri informed on the context of your life and with the ability to actually do things on your phone. Apple is only realizing that vision in 2026, Bloomberg reports, through a combination of its own AI models, and at least one third-party model from its competitors. In June, the company was reportedly considering using a model from either OpenAI or Anthropic, but as of August, the company is now apparently circling a partnership with Google.

Now, less than six months later, the company is introducing Sonnet 4. 5, and calling it the best coding model in the world to date. Anthropic's basis for that claim is a selection of benchmarks where the new AI outperforms not only its predecessor but also the more expensive Opus 4. 1 and competing systems, including Google's Gemini 2. 5 Pro and GPT-5 from OpenAI. For instance, in OSWorld, a suite that tests AI models on real-world computer tasks, Sonnet 4. 5 set a record score of 61. 4 percent, putting it 17 percentage points above Opus 4. 1. At the same time, the new model is capable of autonomously working on multi-step projects for more than 30 hours, a significant improvement from the seven or so hours Opus 4 could maintain at launch. That's an important milestone for the type of agentic systems Anthropic wants to build. Sonnet 4. 5 outperforms Anthropic's older models in coding and agentic tasks. AnthropicPerhaps more importantly, the company claims Sonnet 4. 5 is its safest AI system to date, with the model having undergone ""extensive"" safety training. That training translates to a chatbot Anthropic says is ""substantially"" less prone to ""sycophancy, deception, power-seeking and the tendency to encourage delusional thinking"" all potential model traits that have landed OpenAI in hot water in recent months. At the same time, Anthropic has strengthened Sonnet 4. 5's protections against prompt injection attacks. Due to the sophistication of the new model, Anthropic is releasing Sonnet 4. 5 under its AI Safety Level 3 framework, meaning it comes with filters designed to prevent potentially dangerous outputs related to prompts around chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. A chart showing how Sonnet 4. 5 compares against other frontier models in safety testing. AnthropicWith today's announcement, Anthropic is also rolling out quality of life improvements across the Claude product stack. To start, Claude Code, the company's popular coding agent, has a refreshed terminal interface, with a new feature called checkpoints included. As you can probably guess from the name, they allow you to save your progress and roll back to a previous state if Claude writes some funky code that isn't quite working like you imagined it would. File creation, which Anthropic began rolling out at the start of the month, is now available to all Pro users, and if you joined the waitlist Claude for Chrome, you can start using the extension today. API pricing for Sonnet 4. 5 remains at $3 per one million input tokens and $15 for the same amount of output tokens. The release of Sonnet 4. 5 caps off a strong September for Anthropic. Just one day after Microsoft added Claude models to Copilot 365 last week, OpenAI admitted its rival offers the best AI for work-related tasks.

2493e350-d592-46a6-866f-f78b64abe35a,OpenAI will reportedly release a TikTok-like social app alongside Sora 2,Engadget,https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-will-reportedly-release-a-tiktok-like-social-app-alongside-sora-2-205842527.html?src=rss,"In a development that should surprise no one, OpenAI is preparing to release a standalone social app powered by its upcoming Sora 2 video model, Wired reports. The app reportedly ""closely resembles"" TikTok, with a vertical video feed and swipe-to-scroll navigation. The catch? It will only feature AI-generated content; there's apparently no option for the user to upload photos or videos from their phone's camera roll. Wired adds OpenAI will limit Sora 2 to generating clips that are 10 seconds long or shorter for use inside of the app. It's unclear what the model's limit will be outside of the app. TikTok, following an original limit of 15 seconds, allows people to upload clips that are up to 10 minutes long. The new app is also said to include an identity verification tool. Should a user take advantage of the feature, Sora 2 will be able to use their likeness in videos it generates. In turn, that means other people will be able to tag those users and use their likeness when they go to remix one of their videos. As a safety precaution, OpenAI will push a notification to users whenever their likeness is used by someone else, even in situations where someone makes a video but never posts it to the app's feed. According to Wired, the software will refuse to generate some videos due to copyright restrictions. However, it's not clear just how robust these protections will be, with The Wall Street Journal reporting OpenAI will require rights holders to opt out of their content appearing in videos Sora 2 generates. As for why OpenAI would release a social media app, Wired suggests the company saw an opportunity after President Trump repeatedly extended the deadline for ByteDance to bring TikTok's US business under American control. By adding a social component to Sora, OpenAI may also be hoping to dissuade people from trying other models since leaving its new app would mean abandoning whatever community forms around it.

California is the home to top AI companies including OpenAI, Alphabets Google, Meta Platforms, Nvidia and Anthropic, and with this law seeks to lead on regulation of an industry critical to its economy, Newsom said. California has proven that we can establish regulations to protect our communities while also ensuring that the growing AI industry continues to thrive, Newsom said in a press release. Newsoms office said the law, known as SB 53, fills a gap left by the U. S. Congress, which so far has not passed broad AI legislation, and provides a model for the U. S. to follow. If federal standards are put in place, Newsom said, the state legislature should ensure alignment with those standards all while maintaining the high bar established by SB 53. Last year, Newsom vetoed Californias first attempt at AI legislation, which had faced fierce industry pushback. The bill would have required companies that spent more than $100 million on their AI models to hire third-party auditors annually to review risk assessments and allowed the state to levy penalties in the hundreds of millions of dollars. The new law requires companies with more than $500 million in revenue to assess the risk that their cutting-edge technology could break free of human control or aid the development of bioweapons, and disclose those assessments to the public. It allows for fines of up to $1 million per violation. Jack Clark, co-founder of AI company Anthropic, called the law a strong framework that balances public safety with continued innovation. The industry still hopes for a federal framework that would replace the California law, as well as others like it enacted recently in Colorado and New York. Last year, a bid by some Republicans in the U. S. Congress to block states from regulating AI was voted down in the Senate 99-1. The biggest danger of SB 53 is that it sets a precedent for states, rather than the federal government, to take the lead in governing the national AI market creating a patchwork of 50 compliance regimes that startups dont have the resources to navigate, said Collin McCune, head of government affairs at Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. U. S. Representative Jay Obernolte, a California Republican, is working on AI legislation that could preempt some state laws, his office said, although it declined to comment further on pending legislation. Some Democrats are also discussing how to enact a federal standard. Its not whether were gonna regulate AI, its do you want 17 states doing it, or do you want Congress to do it? U. S. Representative Ted Lieu, a Democrat from Los Angeles, said at a recent hearing on AI legislation in the U. S. House of Representatives. Reuters.",2025-09-30 06:43:59+00:00,True,True

d8216545-a402-4f21-accb-5e0d15b92400,Now OpenAI is coming for LinkedIn,Fast Company,https://www.fastcompany.com/91410238/openai-is-coming-for-linkedin-openai-linkedin-human-resources?partner=rss&amp;utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=rss+fastcompany&amp;utm_content=rss,"As press releases go, it was a mic drop moment. On September 4, OpenAI announced that it was coming after LinkedIn. And it was coming after job search specifically. For those unfamiliar with the story, it was reported across multiple sources that not content with torpedoing Google, education, interpersonal relationships, and entire industries such as psychiatry or management consultancy (both smugly considered untouchable until about 15 minutes ago), OpenAI is now coming after the age-old industry of human resources. Its yet another cold, logical extension of artificial intelligences purported ability to reduce human intuition down to a series of predictable algorithmic factors. LinkedIn Dethroned? Now, lets be fair. OpenAIs proposition assumes (probably rightly) that virtually all future roles will require some degree of AI knowledge or fluency. Moreover, the press release breathlessly proposes an OpenAI Academy, one that will train the machine-picked workers of the future on how to best serve their artificial overlords. But will this really be enough to dethrone LinkedIn? An incumbent platform of over 1 billion people who now spend the bulk of their time not in job search or hiring, but in perpetual AI comment-discussions about the nature of authenticity while posting Canva-selfies of their weekend getaway to Puglia? Perhaps we should first recognize that human resources is one of the oldest and most safeguarded functions within the corporate world, holding out defiantly as personal assistance, finance, and even marketing have been variously usurped by automation. Its a curiously old-fashioned industry in many respects, relying on judgments about physical appearance and behavioral norms such as eye contact and punctualitycharacteristics that in any other sector would be subordinated to ones ability to deliver value or output. But recently, HR has gone through something of a transformation, and its safe to say that LinkedIn has been at the heart of that. In fact, the worlds largest business platform been an unwitting catalyst for an onslaught of AI-driven fraudboth from candidates (either building fake AI profiles or even replacing themselves in Zoom interviews with omniscient AI avatars), or from dubious recruiters (leveraging advanced AI tools to build fictitious companies in order to solicit payment or personal details). The market is now flooded with AI cover letters, AI resumes and AI-curated portfolios, while on the other side of the table, the screening process is often (and increasingly) handed off to AI scanning software, in order to save valuable time filtering out unsuitable candidates before proceeding to a final interviewone that may ultimately be conducted and processed by an AI avatar. Surely then its simply a short step to full automation, one that removes these very ghosts in the hiring machine? Perhaps. But Id suggest that any scholar of organizational psychology would hold a very different view. The intangibles We can look, for example, at evidence highlighting the predictive power of nonverbal cues such as vocal tone, facial expressions, and body language in forecasting later job performance. Yet suffice to say, these same factors are also deeply subjective. Economists have long shown that reliance on intuition and first impressions can also be a major source of bias in recruitment, perpetuating disparities around race, gender, and class. AI proxies Whatever the case, the stark reality is that we now find ourselves in an era where a growing majority of both candidates and recruiters are using AI as proxies. And in this world, the very notion of authentic observationwhether helpful or notis starting to erode. ButI hear you cry as onesurely HR isnt just about hiring? Its about people management, professional development, organizational health, and so many other things? Yesexcept that of all these functions, hiring has historically required the highest amount of dedicated resource, training, and physical presence, far outstripping what can now be done by AI in areas such as coaching, psychometric testing, and even therapy. If we delegate the very function of organizational building itself, what remains must necessarily become diminished, at least in part. To circle back then to OpenAI, perhaps iterative machine learning will finally win out. Perhaps time might tell us that the match between employee and role is near-flawless in an AI, dehumanized world. And yet, it may also be this very unpredictability of human nature that will represent the biggest loss to a future workforce. And as to the suggestion that OpenAIs hiring platform will take down LinkedIn itself? If it can somehow balance hiring efficiency with the high level of fluffy, eye-pleasing pseudo-business interactions that now so predominate on LinkedIn itself, perhaps. But to do that, youd need to first understand a little of the idiosyncrasies of human nature, in order to build (and foster) an appropriately sticky forumif only for the reason that business is a gateway into so many other areas of recreational and emotional life. And doing that, Im afraid to say, still requires a deeply human sensibility.",2025-09-30 09:58:00+00:00,True,False

Sora lets you create realistic AI videos of yourself, friends, and other people. Sora uses the Sora 2 video generation model, which OpenAI says is more physically accurate, realistic, and controllable than prior systems. It is able to generate complex movements while better obeying the laws of physics, and OpenAI says it excels at realistic, cinematic, and anime styles. Sora 2 supports generating video that also includes audio, such as real-sounding speech, background soundscapes, and sound effects. The AI model is able to observe a video of a person and then insert them into a Sora-generated environment while accurately portraying their appearance and voice, which is the basis for the new Sora app. With the Sora app, you can create a video of yourself that can then be inserted into ""cameos,"" which are short videos that are shared with others on the Sora social network. You can opt to allow other people to create cameos with your likeness as well. You can choose who can use your cameo, and you will see all videos that include cameos with your likeness, even drafts before they are published to the network. OpenAI designed Sora to show you content based on people you follow or interact with, and the app will poll you regularly on your wellbeing. There are controls to modify what's displayed in a feed, and OpenAI says that it is meant to be used with friends. For that reason, Sora is invite only, ensuring people join the app alongside people they know. The Sora app for iOS is available to download now, and it can be used in the United States and Canada. Those invited to the app will be able to use Sora 2 on the Sora website. Sora 2 is free for now, and ChatGPT Pro users have access to the Sora 2 Pro model on Sora. com.

Bloomberg has reported that the company has authorized a secondary share sale, which allowed its former and current employees to sell their stocks. OpenAI had authorized the sale of $10. 3 billion in shares, but they ultimately sold $6. 6 billion to investors that include Softbank, Abu Dhabi government's MGX fund, American investment firm Thrive Capital and global investment management firm T. Rowe Price. As Bloomberg explains, that has boosted the company's valuation to $500 billion from $300 billion, overtaking SpaceX with a $400 billion valuation and TikTok developer ByteDance at $220 billion. In early September, OpenAI said it was getting closer to transitioning to a new structure that will turn it into a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) controlled by its nonprofit arm. The company's nonprofit division received an equity stake of more than $100 billion, making it a major shareholder of the PBC. SpaceX's CEO Elon Musk is one of the biggest critics of OpenAI's decision and has been trying to block the company's for-profit transition in court. Musk was one of OpenAI's founders and funded its initial operations. He claimed in court that OpenAI and Altman are breaking their contract with him and violating the company's founding mission of building AI ""for the benefit of humanity"" by changing its structure. OpenAI is hoping that being a PBC would make it more appealing to investors, as it would remove the cap on the financial returns they can get. It needs a lot more money than what it has raised so far, after all: OpenAI chief Sam Altman previously said he intends to spend trillions of dollars on building out data centers to run artificial intelligence services.

Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, has embarked on a global supply-chain and fundraising campaign to boost his companys computing capacity. Since late September, the OpenAI executive has sought alternative long-term low-cost supplies for his companys multi-trillion-dollar infrastructure plan. Altman is looking to the Middle East and East Asia to finance the accelerated build-out of his companys infrastructure. He has so far visited South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan and has met with representatives from Foxconn, TSMC, SK Hynix, and Samsung. Altman previously claimed that his $850 billion OpenAI expansion plan is valid, as reported by Cryptopolitan. He acknowledged that people are worried about his companys expansion, but emphasized that he is not backing down from the plans. The OpenAI boss said the biggest issue is not chips or money but power. Altman recently led a $500M funding round for fusion firm Helion Energy and helped fission startup Oklo go public through his SPAC. Altman plans to visit the UAE for more AI infrastructure and research funds The tech billionaire has planned a visit to the UAE, where he will meet investors.

However, some industry leaders dismissed his previous effort as unrealistic, given the limited revenue generated by AI services at the time. Shortly after the 2024 UAE trip, TSMCs CEO, C. C. Wei, said that Altman was too aggressive, but now believes the OpenAI boss will garner more support this time.

SoftBank and OpenAI announced that they have agreed a partnership to set up a joint venture for artificial intelligence services in Japan today. Its so reckless or whatever. Those are the words of Open AI CEO Sam Altman as he explains the expected reaction to what he predicts will be trillions worth of spending by OpenAI on data center construction, and other attempts to discover a very different Artificial Intelligence-infused future. Whats important for the purposes of this opinion piece is that according to Cade Metz and Karen Weise of the New York Times, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Meta and OpenAI are on track to spend $325 billion in pursuit of a different AI tomorrow in 2025 alone. Which should open some eyes about what capital and credit are versus what economists purport them to be. To believe economists from left, right and center, the Federal Reserve is the proverbial green or red light on the matter of economic growth. On the left, future Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke famously commented about the 1930s that We did it, as in the Fed allegedly kept so-called ""money supply below what it should have been, thus the downturn. In a recent piece for RealClearMarkets, right-of-center economist Charles Calomiris joined what is a near-monolithic consensus among economists that The Fed caused the Great Depression through persistent monetary contraction (1929-1933).

Now, OpenAI has come to another agreement, this time with NVIDIA's competitor, AMD. OpenAI has announced a deal to use AMD's chips to create six gigawatts worth of AI infrastructure. AMD expects to make ""tens of billions of dollars"" from this agreement. According to OpenAI, AMD will act ""as a core strategic compute partner to drive large-scale deployments"" of its technology. OpenAI will use AMD's Instinct GPUs, with plans to deploy the first gigawatt of the Instinct MI450 GPUs during the second half of 2026 ""AMDs leadership in high-performance chips will enable us to accelerate progress and bring the benefits of advanced AI to everyone faster,"" Sam Altman, co-founder and CEO of OpenAI, said in a statement. The deal will also give OpenAI the chance to purchase 160 million AMD shares at a penny each. These shares will vest over time as different milestones are reached starting with that first one gigawatt deployment. Ultimately, these shares would give OpenAI up to a 10 percent stake in AMD. Agreements between major AI players are popping up everywhere. In its recent deal with NVIDIA, OpenAI plans to use the former's chips to make at least 10 gigawatts of AI data centers. The $100 billion investment will come in waves timed to each new gigawatt of power. This process should also start during the second half of 2026. OpenAI is also working with Microsoft on ways to share technology, with the latter having invested over $13 billion in the former for 49 percent of its profits. Meanwhile, Nvidia recently invested $5 billion in Intel to ""seamlessly"" connect ""the strengths of NVIDIAs AI and accelerated computing with Intels leading CPU technologies and x86 ecosystem."" Intel has also been tasked with creating NVIDIA-custom x86 CPUs for the market and AI infrastructure platforms. This article originally appeared on Engadget at.",2025-10-06 13:48:16+00:00,True,False

Topline AMD stock soared as trading opened Monday morning, after the chipmaker announced a multibillion-dollar deal with OpenAI in a move that could challenge AI giant Nvidia, which earlier announced plans to acquire a stake in rival Intel. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and AMD Chair and CEO Lisa Su at a Senate Commerce Committee hearing on AI. Getty Images Key Facts OpenAI will acquire and deploy 6 gigawatts of AMDs AI chips, starting with a 1-gigawatt deployment in 2026, both companies said in an announcement. The chipmaker issued OpenAI a warrant for up to 160 million shares, representing an estimated 10% stake in AMD at $0. 01 per share, which will be vested once specific share-price milestones are met, according to a regulatory filing by AMD. Shares will be vested in multiple tranches and be tied to a rise in AMDs stock price, which must triple to $600 for the final tranche, according to the filing. Neither companys announcement mentioned the exact value of the deal, but AMD noted that its partnership with the ChatGPT-maker is expected to deliver tens of billions of dollars in revenue for AMD. The deal is AMDs most significant win in its attempt to challenge Nvidias dominance in the AI chip market, and also helps OpenAI reduce its dependence on Nvidias GPUs. How Has Amds Stockand The Marketreacted To The Deal? Shares of AMD increased by more than 30% to around $215 after trading opened Monday, pacing what would be the stocks largest single-day gain since April 2016. AMD headlined a broader rally by the tech-heavy Nasdaq, which ticked up by 0. 3%, with rises among Micron (6%), Palantir (4. 9%), Intel (4%) and Tesla, whose shares rose 3% after the automaker released teaser footage of what appeared to be a new model.

Challenging King Nvidia Please click here for an enlarged chart of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD). Note the following: This article is about the big picture, not an individual stock. The chart of AMD stock is being used to illustrate the point. The chart shows the jump up in AMD stock on the news of the deal with OpenAI. The chart shows AMD stock is in zone 1 (resistance). The chart shows our buy zone. RSI on the chart shows AMD stock is overbought. Overbought stocks are susceptible to a pullback. Here are the key points about the AMD and OpenAI partnership: The partnership includes AI data centers to run on AMD chips, not NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA) chips. OpenAI or its cloud computing partners will purchase 6 gigawatts of AMD chips starting next year. The chips will be used for inference and computations required for chatbots and other AI applications to respond to users. The deal is expected to bring in tens of billions of dollars of revenue to AMD over the next five years. OpenAI is to receive warrants awarded in phases for as many as 160M shares of AMD stock at $0. 01 per share. That is approximately 10% of AMD. The price of AMD stock must increase in order for the warrants to be exercised. The OpenAI AMD deal is a challenge to AI King Nvidia. In our analysis, Nvidia will remain the king for training AI models, and AMD will make great inroads in inference. The OpenAI AMD deal is overshadowing everything else in the stock market. The U.

OpenAI says that this work was purportedly done for a government client. The tool was a ""probe"" that could crawl social media sites like X, Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, TikTok and YouTube for specific political, ethnic or religious content as defined by the operator. The company said it cannot independently verify if the tool was used by a Chinese government entity. OpenAI disrupted similar efforts earlier this year. The company also says it banned an account that was using ChatGPT to develop a proposal for a tool described as a ""High-Risk Uyghur-Related Inflow Warning Model"" that would aid in tracking the movements of ""Uyghur-related"" individuals. China has long been accused of alleged human rights abuses against Uyghur Muslims in the country. OpenAI began publishing threat reports in February 2024, raising awareness of state-affiliated actors using large language models to debug malicious code, develop phishing scams and more. The company's latest blog post serves as a roundup of notable threats and banned accounts over the last quarter. The company also caught Russian-, Korean- and Chinese-speaking developers using ChatGPT to refine malware, as well as entire networks in Cambodia, Myanmar and Nigeria using the chatbot to help create scams in an attempt to defraud people. According to OpenAI's own estimates, ChatGPT is being used to detect scams three times as often as it is to create them. This summer, OpenAI disrupted operations in Iran, Russia and China that were using ChatGPT to create posts, comments and to drive engagement and division as part of online influence campaigns. The AI-generated content was used on various social media platforms in both the originating nations and internationally.

Under the deal, OpenAI will design the chips to its own specifications and Broadcom will manage the development and fabrication of the chips, as well as help with their deployment. The companies plan to deploy enough chips to require 10 gigawatts of electrical power beginning in mid-2026, and running through 2029. Broadcom stock jumped almost 10% on the announcement Monday. The deal marks the second major move by OpenAI to reduce its dependence on Nvidia, which now dominates the AI chip market-the company announced a partnership with chipmaker AMD last week. The Broadcom partnership is part of a many-pronged effort by OpenAI to dramatically scale up the computing power it uses to train and operate AI models. Within its “Stargate” initiative to add data centers, the company has attracted large investments from Softbank, Oracle, Nvidia, AMD, and MGX. Coreweave, Microsoft, and ARM will play supporting roles. OpenAI also signed a $300 billion deal with Oracle to buy computing power within existing Oracle data centers. The massive infrastructure investments represent the largest single force buoying up the U. S. stock market. AI companies and their investors believe that generative AI systems are about to revolutionize the way companies do business, from accounting to engineering to operations. AI may prove to be a transformative technology wave on the order of the internet or mobile (or, some even say, electricity). It might also prove to be something more like the metaverse that has lots of potential but will take time to mature. A lot of money, and perhaps the health of the U. S. economy, is riding on the answer to that question.",2025-10-13 18:54:20+00:00,True,False

7584e2ca-2fdd-4923-96c2-4fe20436c3dd,OpenAI’s true ambition isn’t about chabots. It’s about a ‘super app’,Fast Company,https://www.fastcompany.com/91417700/openai-true-ambition-super-app?partner=rss&amp;utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=rss+fastcompany&amp;utm_content=rss,"OpenAI never wanted to build a chatbot. As an early beta tester for OpenAI’s GPT-3 model, I can vouch for the fact that the company was caught totally off guard by ChatGPT’s runaway success. An email that OpenAI sent me on November 28, 2022-just two days before ChatGPT came to market and kicked off a trillion-dollar, multiyear, economy-distending AI scramble-didn’t even mention the new interface. Rather, it bragged about the company’s then-revolutionary “DaVinci” model and how it could “deliver clearer, more engaging, and more compelling content” and allow developers to “take on tasks that would have previously been too difficult to achieve.” From the breathless tone of the email, it was clear that OpenAI had bigger ambitions than creating a text-based tool to help you argue with your insurance company or write KPop Demon Hunters fanfics. As Nick Turley, OpenAI’s head of product, admitted this week, the company “got a little sidetracked” by ChatGPT. Now OpenAI’s true ambitions are becoming increasingly clear. In Turley’s words, OpenAI “never meant to build a chatbot.” Instead, the company always planned “to build a super assistant.” And that’s exactly what it’s now doing. The ‘super app’ In America, our app landscape is highly fragmented. Yes, if you want to know how fast bamboo grows or figure out the chords for R. E. M.’s 1985 classic “Wendell Gee,” you might fire up the ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini app and ask the bots. If you want to post to social media, though, you’re likely to reach for Instagram, TikTok, or-perhaps steeling yourself for the possibility of encountering MechaHitler-X. Need to bank? Open up the crappy app for your local bank branch with the UI from 2012, and hope for the best. Buying something? There’s Amazon, Instacart, and DoorDash for that. Want to secretly determine how much wealth your friends have accumulated? Zillow to the rescue! In other parts of the world, apps aren’t like that at all. Many countries, especially in Asia, have super apps that integrate all those functions and more into one tool, often controlled by a single, über-influential company. In China, WeChat provides messaging and gaming, but also mobile payments, social media, and mini apps for things like ride-hailing, paying bills, and even getting city services. In many Southwest Asian countries, Grab provides financial services, rides, food delivery, and much else. In the Middle East, Careem provides similar functions. Africa, Latin America, and many other geographies have similar super apps. America doesn’t. And to American technology companies, that’s a big problem. Because the apps are so all-encompassing, their creators control incredible amounts of capital and power. Tencent, the company behind WeChat, had revenues of more than $90 billion and profits approaching $30 billion in 2024-much of it driven by WeChat-and is growing fast. That’s an especially colossal sum in China, making Tencent one of the country's most profitable companies, behind only a handful of largely state-controlled banks and conglomerates. Here in America, Elon Musk had ambitions to turn X into a super app, but his politics and penchant for second grade humor got in the way. No one else has really taken up the gauntlet. Until now. OpenAI Eats Everything At its October 2025 “Developer Day,” OpenAI made clear that it intends to create a super app, and will spend an almost limitless amount of money to make that happen. During the event, the company announced the ability to run apps directly within the ChatGPT interface. These are very similar to the “mini apps” that have made WeChat so powerful. Initial partners include Spotify and Zillow, but the list will inevitably grow. Simultaneously, the company has rolled out multiple functions that make it look less like a chatbot maker and more like a super-app company. Last week, OpenAI launched new features that let the bot spend your money for you, as well as a protocol to allow direct purchasing from any merchant who opts in. OpenAI’s Sora social network-where all the content is joyfully fake-takes on TikTok and has immediately leapt to the No. 1 spot in Apple’s App Store. And earlier this year, OpenAI shared that it plans to launch a browser to rival the ubiquitous Google Chrome. OpenAI seems to suddenly be everywhere, doing everything. That broad-ranging ambition is the hallmark of a super-app maker. And again, if all the signals weren’t clear enough, Turley essentially confirmed the company’s new direction with his “super assistant” comments. So, will it work? If any company can create a super app, it’s OpenAI. With its wild consumer success, the company has access to bottomless pits of capital. ChatGPT has 800 million weekly active users, and that number continues to grow. OpenAI is the first company in a generation to create an entirely new way of interacting with computers. Its intelligent chat interface lends itself to the integration of other apps and services. My own experience using Instant Checkout confirms that buying things within the ChatGPT interface really is seamless. Still, America’s existing tech titans won’t go quietly. Google is reportedly expanding its own Gemini app, and its Nano Banana system proves it can still grab the public’s attention. Meta already has its own Sora doppelgänger. And while OpenAI is growing quickly, its revenue is only around $10 billion-a drop in the bucket compared to Google’s $350 billion, and still a fraction of the revenue of its Chinese super-app rivals. OpenAI would love to take over every aspect of your digital life. And it may. But despite the hype, the company still has a very long way to go.",2025-10-14 08:00:00+00:00,True,False

Walmart and OpenAI just announced an new partnership to make Walmart's products shoppable . and buyable right in ChatGPT Getty Images The “Buy Now” button is coming to ChatGPT, and Walmart is a big part of that. The alliance is a shot across the bow of e-commerce giant Amazon, which owns about 40% of the entire U. S. retail e-commerce market, compared to only 6. 4% for Walmart. The move is strategic on multiple levels. AI-driven answer engines like ChatGPT are rapidly becoming the go-to entry point to the internet for younger people when they have questions that need answers. This displaces Google, to an extent, and disrupts search engine optimization tactics that have long driven e-commerce traffic and revenue. While Amazon is a massive product search engine in its own right, the user experience is getting worse and worse as ads occupy most of the top Amazon product search results and prices rise thanks to the platform’s fees on sellers. So Walmart is attempting to capitalize on emerging consumer behavior changes to capture more market share. “For many years now, eCommerce shopping experiences have consisted of a search bar and a long list of item responses,"" Walmart president and CEO Doug McMillon said in a statement. “That is about to change.” Walmart is betting that people want to ask ChatGPT what is the best dishwasher or hair dryer, or even ask ChatGPT to order them some toilet paper or oranges. While the last two might require additional cultural shifts, the first two are getting more and more commonplace. “ChatGPT drives ~52 million daily purchase-related conversations,” Shelfsight founder Joe Murphy said recently, citing a study released last month titled How People Use.",2025-10-14 22:08:24+00:00,True,False

OpenAI is constantly in the news with a new consumer app or feature, and is being billed as the next great consumer tech platform. Most recently it made news by offering a social network around its Sora image generator, and even says it plans to allow NSFW content on ChatGPT. Anthropic, meanwhile, has chosen a different path. The company stresses that because it gets most of its revenues from businesses and developers, it’s not trying to capture the mass market, and it’s not terribly concerned about how long users spend on its platform every day. “We are interested in our consumer users to the degree they are doing work, solving problems in their life,” says Anthropic design chief Joel Lewenstein during an interview with Fast Company this week. “Because we're not interested in passive consumption and image generation and video generation-we just sort of have ruled those out from a mission perspective .” Anthropic was famously founded by a group of OpenAI execs who defected in 2021 to found a more safety-focused AI lab. That focus hasn’t changed. “Our interests are in making things that are beneficial while minimizing the risks of those same products because everything has a double-edged sword,” Lewenstein says. “We see . helping people grow and expand and create and solve problems as being the right risk-reward tradeoff.” The San Francisco-based startup believes that work-first focus will ultimately win out as AI eventually shows its profoundest effects in the lives of businesses, not consumers. At a conference Wednesday, Anthropic’s cofounder and policy director Jack Clark says Anthropic will eventually overtake OpenAI because of its enterprise focus, its strong technological roadmap, and because its research is “accelerating faster” than its rival’s. All of this is reflected in the look and feel of its Claude chatbot-the main entry to access Anthropic’s powerful models-but also in its attitude. Not warm and fuzzy When it comes to work, Claude is pleasant, even empathetic, but serious-and it comes with a free BS detector. “Sycophancy” in AI models, after all, has become a serious problem. OpenAI recently admitted having to push an update to its GPT-4o model to fix its sycophantic behavior. And its CEO Sam Altman stated in a post on Oct. 14 that users will be able to reintroduce that personality if they liked it. The model reportedly had a habit of praising or validating user statements even when they were delusional or concerning (one user claimed a divine identity). Some analysts believe that such behavior in a model is more than a bug, but a choice made by the model maker in the interest of getting people to use the platform more. A sycophantic chatbot in a work setting can act something like a yes-man, embracing and offering to further develop even the worst business ideas. This can lead to a range of reputational and financial harms, not to mention seriously damaging trust in the AI. Sychophantic AI could be especially dangerous to Anthropic, which wants its user to use Claude not just for quick content generation, but as a collaborator or thinking partner to do serious work. In order to do that, the user needs to build confidence and trust in the reasonableness of the AI. So Anthropic trained the models behind Claude to push back on logically suspect thoughts from the user. Lewenstein says his company worked especially hard to train this into its newest model, Claude Haiku 4. 5, which it says is the most sycophancy-resistant model available in its size. The ‘artifacts’ shift The idea of “Claude as collaborator” has directly impacted the chatbot’s user interface. With the introduction of “Artifacts” last year, Anthropic added a highly functional workspace around the chatbot. The idea of the Artifacts UX is to show a working draft of the project the user and the AI are working on in real time, within a panel at the right side of the interface. This might be a document draft, a chart, or a code preview, which the user can inspect, click, highlight, and suggest changes. The user can tell Claude to write something in a new way, or integrate a new idea from an uploaded PDF or text file. “I cannot overstate how big of a shift that is, and [it] anchors a lot of the way that we think,” Lewenstein says. By this he means that Artifacts encourages the user to think of Claude as a smart work companion, rather than just a content generator. “It creates this sense of you're making something alongside Claude,” Lewenstein says. “We're not just giving you the answer. We're not having you just download it and we're done .” Rather, the human and chatbot enter a dialog where they gradually shape the output into what the user wants. Lewenstein acknowledges that while AI tools have a growing number of power users, a significant percentage of users have yet to scratch the surface of what’s possible. He says a major challenge of the user interface design is to invite people to Claude’s features more fully. Artifacts can show users their options so that they can proceed in an experimental way, learning as they go. And, as of last month, Claude now can automatically remember past chats, so it might proactively ask if the user wants to include some theme or piece of data (perhaps a relevant piece of proprietary product research or a business plan) it’s encountered before. “I think the more things that Claude is able to do-Claude can now make PowerPoints and make Excel documents-the more things that it makes, the more important it is that there is some space that you can actually see and engage with that content,” Lewenstein says. The reason Claude can make presentations and spreadsheets is because of “skills,” or packets of knowledge that Claude can call up when the user needs them. On Thursday, a day after announcing its new Claude Haiku 4. 5 model, the company announced that Claude users can now make their own “agent skills."" If a user worked with Claude to create a presentation, for example, and called in a number of style sheets and marketing guidelines to do it, they can package all that work up in a skill and use it again the next time they need to do a presentation. In essence, Claude is enabling a user to create a kind of agent that has expertise and experience working with the user on a specific task. Agents AI agents can reason and act autonomously to do things like fetch data, perform actions, create plans. OpenAI recently announced a new tool called Agent Builder that provides a simple, graphical interface to create agents, define their workflows, and pull in tools the agent can use (a safety guardrail tool, for example). OpenAI says this could speed up the process for developers, and reduce the need to build agents from scratch. Anthropic believes that the right UX for building and managing agents depends on the type of user and their level of expertise. When developers within businesses build agents, Lewenstein explains, they write them as code, and Anthropic provides them a number of governance and security tools to help manage them. There’s no abstraction layer that represents the parts as objects that can be dragged around on a screen (at least not yet). Lewenstein says consumers, prosumers, and average knowledge workers usually just want to describe a goal they want the agent to achieve, then let the AI carry out the necessary functions behind the scenes to make it happen. That's the direction Anthropic is pursuing now. “Whether users even want to think about agents as a concept remains an open question,” he says. Still, Anthropic is exploring several different kinds of agent approaches within Claude, some of them tightly integrated with chat, some of them less so. The focus is on what people are trying to accomplish, Lewenstein says. “Anthropic will provide whatever is needed in any form factor to achieve that, and the company isn't wedded to any particular UX paradigm yet.” He cites the old marketing adage: “Users don’t really want a quarter-inch drill bit, they want a quarter-inch hole.” Claude of the future Right now, users are still trying to understand how AI agents can fit into their overall workflows. In a work setting they may be skeptical that the agent will produce reliable, actionable work. They will naturally want to know a lot about how the agent is doing its work, how it's getting from a directive to a result. Lewenstein says that Claude now lets users click to see all the steps the agent (powered by the model) took to reach a result. Building that into the UX, he says, wasn’t a terribly challenging problem. But, over time, Claude will become more autonomous and capable of working unsupervised for longer periods of time (already the Claude Sonnet 4. 5 model can work by itself for 30 hours). This could create challenges for the UX, which will have to show an audit of every step in the work that was done. “We have these components in the UI which we've been working on for the last couple of years, which is a short little summary and then if you expand it, it actually shows you, ‘Here's everything I did for the last X hours,’ so that you can really build up an understanding but also a trust.” In the first phases of AI agents being used within enterprises, users will have to think through what tasks they can delegate to agents, and what tasks to keep for themselves. Future versions of Claude, Lewenstein says, might help the user understand this. “I think this is the future of where a lot of these products need to go-understanding someone's workflow enough, [and] its own capabilities enough, to proactively say, ‘I will take this work off your plate and I will leave you with this thing,’ and that should feel very empowering to people,” Lewenstein says. An AI for work Even for its consumer users, Anthropic is interested in helping them do work, not pass the time. So the same Claude user interface works pretty well for both personal and business use cases, Lewenstein says. He says consumers use Claude for a lot of personal things that might as well be work things-complex problems like planning a vacation or navigating a complicated renovation. “We see consumers or people who are not doing it for their employer finding a lot of benefit in basically all the same basic features that we have [in Claude] for work.” Eighty percent of Anthropic’s revenues come from enterprise customers. After crossing $1 billion a year in annualized revenue run rate (ARR) at the beginning of 2025, the company expects to hit $9 billion in ARR by the end of the year, Reuters reports, and then $26 billion in 2026. While OpenAI doesn’t usually talk about its revenue mix, its CFO Sarah Friar said in 2024 that the company made 75% of its money from consumer subscriptions. As of June 2025, OpenAI’s ARR was reportedly $10 billion (excluding licensing revenue from Microsoft and large one-time deals). Analysts expect OpenAI to reach about $12. 7 billion in total revenue in 2025.",2025-10-20 10:00:00+00:00,True,True

The new browser, called ChatGPT Atlas, will initially be available on macOS on the desktop. Versions for Windows, iOS, and Android are coming soon, OpenAI says. OpenAI worked hard to build as many AI-driven features into Atlas as possible. For example, Atlas learns the user’s browsing history and, in some cases, can make content suggestions proactively. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman suggested that this first version of the browser is just the start, pledging to add “way more stuff that we will tell you about later” and adding that the company “can take this pretty far.” The browser also integrates an AI agent, which can perform certain tasks for the users, such as filling out web forms and booking reservations. These things can happen in the background while the user does other things on the web. This, OpenAI says, may cut down on the number of browser tabs that users must currently wade through. However, “agent mode” is only available to OpenAI’s paying Plus and Pro subscribers. The Atlas browser isn’t the only AI-first product out there-Perplexity, for instance, launched its Comet browser earlier this year. But Atlas may pose a serious threat to Google’s dominant Chrome browser, which plays a central role in the company’s advertising business model. “We think AI presents a rare once-in-a-decade opportunity to rethink what a browser can be about,” Altman said at the beginning of the stream.",2025-10-21 18:15:00+00:00,True,False

It’s ChatGPT: “I see you’re traveling to New York this week. Based on your preferences, I’ve found three restaurants near your hotel. Would you like me to make a reservation?” You didn’t ask for this. The AI simply knew your plans from scanning your calendar and email and decided to help. Later, you mention to the chatbot needing flowers for your wife’s birthday. Within seconds, beautiful arrangements appear in the chat. You tap one: “Buy now.” Done. The flowers are ordered. This isn’t science fiction. On Sept. 29, 2025, OpenAI and payment processor Stripe launched the Agentic Commerce Protocol. This technology lets you buy things instantly from Etsy within ChatGPT conversations. ChatGPT users are scheduled to gain access to over 1 million other Shopify merchants, from major household brand names to small shops as well. As marketing researchers who study how AI affects consumer behavior, we believe we’re seeing the beginning of the biggest shift in how people shop since smartphones arrived. Most people have no idea it’s happening. FROM SEARCHING TO BEING SERVED For three decades, the internet has worked the same way: You want something, you Google it, you compare options, you decide, you buy. You’re in control. That era is ending. AI shopping assistants are evolving through three phases. First came “on-demand AI.” You ask ChatGPT a question, it answers. That’s where most people are today. Now we’re entering “ambient AI,” where AI suggests things before you ask. ChatGPT monitors your calendar, reads your emails and offers recommendations without being asked. Soon comes “autopilot AI,” where AI makes purchases for you with minimal input from you. “Order flowers for my anniversary next week.” ChatGPT checks your calendar, remembers preferences, processes payment and confirms delivery. Each phase adds convenience but gives you less control. THE MANIPULATION PROBLEM AI’s responses create what researchers call an “advice illusion.” When ChatGPT suggests three hotels, you don’t see them as ads. They feel like recommendations from a knowledgeable friend. But you don’t know whether those hotels paid for placement or whether better options exist that ChatGPT didn’t show you. Traditional advertising is something most people have learned to recognize and dismiss. But AI recommendations feel objective even when they’re not. With one-tap purchasing, the entire process happens so smoothly that you might not pause to compare options. OpenAI isn’t alone in this race. In the same month, Google announced its competing protocol, AP2. Microsoft, Amazon and Meta are building similar systems. Whoever wins will be in position to control how billions of people buy things, potentially capturing a percentage of trillions of dollars in annual transactions. WHAT WE’RE GIVING UP This convenience comes with costs most people haven’t thought about. Privacy: For AI to suggest restaurants, it needs to read your calendar and emails. For it to buy flowers, it needs your purchase history. People will be trading total surveillance for convenience. Choice: Right now, you see multiple options when you search. With AI as the middleman, you might see only three options ChatGPT chooses. Entire businesses could become invisible if AI chooses to ignore them. Power of comparing: When ChatGPT suggests products with one-tap checkout, the friction that made you pause and compare disappears. IT’S HAPPENING FASTER THAN YOU THINK ChatGPT reached 800 million weekly users by September 2025, growing four times faster than social media platforms did. Major retailers began using OpenAI’s Agentic Commerce Protocol within days of its launch. History shows people consistently underestimate how quickly they adapt to convenient technologies. Not long ago most people wouldn’t think of getting in a stranger’s car. Uber now has 150 million users. Convenience always wins. The question isn’t whether AI shopping will become mainstream. It’s whether people will keep any real control over what they buy and why. WHAT YOU CAN DO The open internet gave people a world of information and choice at their fingertips. The AI revolution could take that away. Not by forcing people, but by making it so easy to let the algorithm decide that they forget what it’s like to truly choose for themselves. Buying things is becoming as thoughtless as sending a text. In addition, a single company could become the gatekeeper for all digital shopping, with the potential for monopolization beyond even Amazon’s current dominance in e-commerce. We believe that it’s important to at least have a vigorous public conversation about whether this is the future people actually want. Here are some steps you can take to resist the lure of convenience: Question AI suggestions. When ChatGPT suggests products, recognize you’re seeing hand-picked choices, not all your options. Before one-tap purchases, pause and ask: Would I buy this if I had to visit five websites and compare prices? Review your privacy settings carefully. Understand what you’re trading for convenience. Talk about this with friends and family. The shift to AI shopping is happening without public awareness. The time to have conversations about acceptable limits is now, before one-tap purchasing becomes so normal that questioning it seems strange. THE INVISIBLE PRICE TAG AI will learn what you want, maybe even before you want it. Every time you tap “Buy now” you’re training it teaching it your patterns, your weaknesses, what time of day you impulse buy. Our warning isn’t about rejecting technology. It’s about recognizing the trade-offs. Every convenience has a cost. Every tap is data. The companies building these systems are betting you won’t notice, and in most cases they’re probably right.

6fc3cf93-4669-41f2-8512-2bcbd2a63c8c,New AI browsers could usher in a web where agents do our bidding—eventually,Fast Company,https://www.fastcompany.com/91427104/openai-chatgpt-atlas-ai-browser?partner=rss&amp;utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=rss+fastcompany&amp;utm_content=rss,"Welcome to AI Decoded, Fast Company’s . I’m Mark Sullivan, a senior writer at Fast Company, covering emerging tech, AI, and tech policy. This week, I’m focusing on the implications of OpenAI’s official entry into the browser game with its ChatGPT Atlas. I also talk to Stanford HAI’s James Landay about the AI industry’s UX design challenges, and examine “AI czar” David Sacks’s recent X skirmish with Democratic billionaire Reid Hoffman. And if you have comments on this issue and/or ideas for future ones, drop me a line at sullivan@fastcompany. com, and follow me on X (formerly Twitter) @thesullivan. With OpenAI’s ChatGPT Atlas, the AI browser war officially kicks off Using the internet with the help of an AI is a real thing-and it became even more real Tuesday when OpenAI, the generative AI industry’s de facto avatar, announced the release of its new ChatGPT Atlas browser. A new race has begun to reinvent the Chrome-style browser experience we’ve used for so long: The race to reinvent the browser around natural language AI. Think of Atlas as an extended workspace and set of features around ChatGPT, specialized for fetching, parsing, and organizing web content. For months, I’ve been using the ChatGPT desktop app. I simply hit a keyboard shortcut, a small chat window appears toward the bottom of my screen, and I ask my question. When I click a source link within the answer, a new Chrome tab opens up behind the chat window. When talking to ChatGPT within Atlas, there’s no need to open that new Chrome tab-everything opens within Atlas. The chatbot stays open on the right, so I can ask it questions about the web page I’m viewing. OpenAI has some other ambitious ideas about how artificial intelligence can be used in browsing. Importantly, Atlas can leverage its memory of the user’s past browsing behavior so that it can more thoughtfully suggest ways of finding and organizing new data or web content. For example, it might remind the user of a specific piece of data they searched for within the same subject area at some point in the past. The user can control how much the browser “remembers,” OpenAI says. Atlas goes beyond fetching web content. It offers to act as the user’s agent, interacting with websites on the user’s behalf. This could mean planning a theater date (complete with dinner reservations, for example) or buying concert tickets when they become available. This kind of autonomous agent is something of a holy grail, both for AI labs trying to build enterprise (work) AI and companies building consumer AI. I’ve heard numerous tech company executives talk as if agents are already advanced enough to make a big difference in business and personal life. Other execs and experts I’ve spoken with say that the agent revolution will not happen this year, and maybe not even next year. That’s because the AI models behind the agents still aren’t good enough to reason through complex tasks. They also still can’t process all the contextual information needed to safely complete high-stakes tasks involving real money (like all the small considerations involved in booking a plane ticket), influential AI researcher (and OpenAI cofounder) Andrej Karpathy points out in a recent podcast. There are other hurdles, too. An entire technology ecosystem must form to accommodate new AI agents, says Devi Parikh, co-CEO of the agentic AI company Yutori. The websites and services of today are built for human users, so agents must learn how to click buttons, scroll pages, and search menus. Because it’s so crucial that users trust these AI agents, she says, AI companies would be wise to err on the conservative side in talking about what AI agents can really do; giving users a bad first impression could damage trust and make them hesitant to rely on agents. While Atlas is getting lots of attention, Google has been (more quietly) upgrading its Chrome browser with AI. Just last month, the company added a spate of features that make its Gemini AI a bigger part of Chrome, saying that the browser is “entering a new era powered by AI.” Within Chrome, Gemini can summarize content, organize tabs, and ask questions about web pages. Google’s new AI search function, now called “AI Mode,” shows up at the top of a wider range of searches and can also be called up using a keyboard shortcut. But Google is building these features onto an existing browser-slash-search tool. That’s very different from building an AI-first browser from scratch as OpenAI did. It’s also true that Google has introduced the AI features in such an understated way that many users probably don’t even know they’re there. (I saw the shortcut to AI Mode in Chrome’s search bar for the very first time Tuesday.) And Google is also freighted with a decades-old business model that knows how to make money from the traditional “10 blue links” search results. So it has to be very careful about how and when it pushes Chrome users toward AI search, which represents a very different revenue model. At any rate, lots of AI talent and money will go into building a new way of using the internet in the coming months and years. Let’s hope the end result is something that helps users more than exploits them. Stanford’s Landay: AI labs need to invest more in product design Lots of people are using AI chatbots now, but the vast majority are free-tier users who employ the tools’ most basic features. They might be comfortable chatting with the AI about some personal matter, but less likely to use it to build a website. At work, they might be apt to look up a policy document, but less comfortable working with the tool to build a report or spreadsheet. The big challenge of designers within AI labs like OpenAI or Google is to build the user interface of AI tools in a way that invites people to use those deeper features, which can offer far greater rewards than the basic ones. But designing software products with UX that’s approachable and easy to use may not be the forte of AI labs, says James Landay, a Stanford computer science and engineering professor who co-directs the university’s Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI). Landay, who specializes in human-computer interaction, consults for a number of tech companies in the Bay Area. A user interface could mean a piece of computer hardware or a software experience that mediates a human’s interaction with an AI. Landay says one of the big challenges of building interfaces for tech products has been that it’s very hard to anticipate the broad set of use cases that people may have, and the user interfaces people might prefer for each of them. Even on the Zoom call I had with Landay, several interface options are available-he may prefer audio-only on a phone, while I may prefer a half-screen mode on my laptop. As for AI apps, a small chat window might be fine for some use cases, while others might call for voice interaction. Still others may need a UX built for viewing images or video. Landay says with AI, it’s unlikely that a dominant form of interface will emerge to muscle out other modes. People will likely want to interact with the technology in a variety of different ways-some old and some new. A slice of the consumer market may decide that the best way to use AI is within the lenses and earpieces of augmented reality glasses. Some may like the idea of an ambient AI in the home, always ready to offer intelligence at the sound of their name (“HAL .”). Landay says the big AI labs haven’t yet moved very far away from the chatbot interface. He says these companies employ people who are primarily interested in natural language AI, so they naturally favor a text-based interface. The AI companies have so far focused most of their energy on improving the models themselves, and relatively little on developing productive ways for humans to interact with the AI. OpenAI’s engagement with the design guru Jony Ive is a sign that the company is at least aware of the need to develop a practical human interface for AI, and willing to invest in possible solutions, Landay says. Ive has indeed invented captivating entry points to mobile computing technology (iPhones and Apple Watches), but AI is another paradigm, and one that might not lend itself easily to an “ideal” piece of hardware or software UX. The David Sacks-Reid Hoffman skirmish on X was mainly about Anthropic David Sacks, the former VC who now works as the “AI czar” in the Trump administration, and Reid Hoffman, the LinkedIn cofounder and big-time Democratic donor, got into a skirmish on X this week. It revealed some things about the politics of AI. On October 20, Hoffman started a thread: “I want to state plainly: In all industries, especially in AI, it’s important to back the good guys. Anthropic is one of the good guys.” Further down, Hoffman points out that others-including Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI-are trying to deploy AI in a way that balances innovation and safety, and is “enormously beneficial for society.” He adds that some AI labs (he doesn’t name names) are making decisions that disregard societal considerations, including some whose bots “sometimes go full fascist.” (Elon Musk’s Grok chatbot reportedly has praised Hitler, dabbled in Holocaust denialism, and ranted about “white genocide” in South Africa.)Whether it was the part about Anthropic or the dig on fascist bots is unclear-but Sacks was triggered. He clapped back: “The leading funder of lawfare and dirty tricks against President Trump wants you to know that ‘Anthropic is one of the good guys.’” Hoffman responded, charging that Sacks didn’t read his full post, adding that it’s “particularly rich” that someone in the Trump administration would accuse someone else of “lawfare and dirty tricks.” The MAGA-fied Sacks naturally has no love for Hoffman, a major Democratic donor. But he also sees Anthropic as a political enemy. His response: “The real issue is not research but rather Anthropic’s agenda to backdoor Woke AI and other AI regulations through Blue states like California.” Anthropic supported California’s Senate Bill 53 (aka the Transparency in Frontier Artificial Intelligence Act), which Gov. Gavin Newsom recently signed into law. Sacks seems to suggest, without citing evidence, that Anthropic is working to get similar laws passed in other states. Sacks also says that Anthropic opposed Trump’s “Big Beautiful [spending] Bill,” the original version of which contained a 10-year moratorium on any new state-level AI regulations-language that was decisively voted out of the bill in the Senate before passage.

Peter Zhang Oct 28, 2025 03: 10 Anthropic partners with US CAISI and UK AISI to strengthen AI safeguards. The collaboration focuses on testing and improving AI security measures, including the development of robust defense mechanisms. Anthropic, a company focused on AI safety and research, has announced a strategic collaboration with the US Center for AI Standards and Innovation (CAISI) and the UK AI Security Institute (AISI). This partnership aims to bolster the security and integrity of AI systems through rigorous testing and evaluation processes, according to Anthropic. Strengthening AI Safeguards The collaboration began with initial consultations and has evolved into a comprehensive partnership. CAISI and AISI teams have been granted access to Anthropic's AI systems at various development stages, allowing for continuous security assessments. The expertise of these government bodies in areas such as cybersecurity and threat modeling has been instrumental in evaluating potential attack vectors and enhancing defense mechanisms. One of the key areas of focus has been the testing of Anthropic's Constitutional Classifiers, which are designed to detect and prevent system jailbreaks. CAISI and AISI have evaluated several iterations of these classifiers on models like Claude Opus 4 and 4. 1, identifying vulnerabilities and suggesting improvements. Key Findings and Improvements The collaboration has uncovered several vulnerabilities, including prompt injection attacks and sophisticated obfuscation methods, which have since been addressed. For instance, government red-teamers identified weaknesses in early classifiers that allowed prompt injection attacks, which involve hidden instructions that trick models into unintended behaviors. These vulnerabilities have been patched, and the safeguard architecture has been restructured to prevent similar issues. Additionally, the partnership has led to the development of automated systems that refine attack strategies, enabling Anthropic to enhance its defenses further. The insights gained have not only improved specific security measures.",2025-10-28 04:23:40+00:00,False,True

Leveraging the new data that OpenAI provided about ChatGPT users and mental health is a vital step forward for societal use of AI. getty In today’s column, I closely examine a new set of data that OpenAI has released about the percentages associated with ChatGPT users experiencing a form of mental health distress or emergency during their interactions with the popular AI. I have repeatedly urged AI makers to provide statistics regarding such weighty matters, enabling society to understand the nature and frequency of these occurrences. I call upon all the major AI makers to do so. Society is pretty much in the dark regarding population-level impacts. The popular LLMs tend to be proprietary; thus, there isn’t a straightforward way to fully gauge the extent of AI-related mental health encounters by users. In the case of ChatGPT, OpenAI has previously noted that they have approximately 800 million weekly active users overall. By applying the newly released percentages of those detected as having a mental health consideration while using the LLM, we can explore a semblance of population-level impacts. Let’s talk about it. This analysis of AI breakthroughs is part of my ongoing Forbes column coverage on the latest in AI, including identifying and explaining various impactful AI complexities (see the link here). AI And Mental Health Therapy As a quick background, I’ve been extensively covering and analyzing a myriad of facets regarding the advent of modern-era AI that produces mental health advice and performs AI-driven therapy. This rising use of AI has principally been spurred by the evolving advances and widespread adoption of generative AI.

Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty Images PayPal has signed a deal with OpenAI to have its digital wallet embedded into ChatGPT so users can pay for items found through the leading consumer AI tool, the company told CNBC exclusively. Shares of the company jumped as much as 14% in premarket trading on the news. The agreement, sealed over the weekend, means that starting next year, both sides of PayPal's ecosystem can plug into ChatGPT: PayPal users can purchase items through the AI platform, and its merchants can sell on it, with their inventory listed there, according to PayPal CEO Alex Chriss. ""We've got hundreds of millions of loyal PayPal wallet holders who now will be able to click the 'Buy with PayPal button' on ChatGPT and have a safe and secure checkout experience,"" Chriss said in an interview. The move makes PayPal an early part of OpenAI's efforts to broaden ChatGPT's use for e-commerce. The thinking is that its 700 million-plus weekly users can lean on artificial intelligence to help them find items, similar to a human personal shopper. Last month, OpenAI said its users could buy from Shopify and Etsy merchants, and two weeks ago it announced an e-commerce deal with Walmart. ""It's a whole new paradigm for shopping,"" Chriss said. ""It's hard to imagine that agentic commerce isn't going to be a big part of the future."" PayPal is attempting to position itself as a payments backbone for the coming era of agentic AI shopping, announcing recent deals with Google and artificial intelligence firm Perplexity. The fintech firm, which also released third-quarter results Tuesday, issued a release on its OpenAI deal after CNBC's report. The company will also manage merchant routing, payment validation and other behind-the-scenes aspects of payment processing for PayPal sellers on ChatGPT, so individual.",2025-10-28 11:34:08+00:00,True,False

OpenAI has announced it will offer Indian users a free one-year subscription to its ChatGPT Go service, targeting the country’s vast market of 1. 4 billion people. The free trial will be available starting November 4, coinciding with OpenAI’s first DevDay Exchange event in India. Users must register in advance to qualify for the offer. By offering ChatGPT Go at no cost, OpenAI is aiming to make AI tools more accessible to a wide range of users, including students, developers, and professionals. Launched in August as India’s most affordable paid plan, ChatGPT Go costs 399 rupees per year, or less than $5. This new initiative marks a major step in OpenAI’s efforts to engage with the Indian market and support the country’s growing AI ecosystem. OpenAI recognizes the large market in India for its ChatGPT Go Since its launch, OpenAI has acknowledged that ChatGPT Go has gained popularity rapidly, helping the company double its paid subscribers in India. This advantage, among others, has led the San Francisco-based startup to position India as its primary focus in the industry, despite extending ChatGPT Go to approximately 90 nations globally. To stay competitive in the AI race, tech companies developing the technology are eyeing India for expansion to attract more users and collect data from millions of English-speaking Indians. Interestingly, sources noted that OpenAI's move illustrates a growing trend among tech companies offering free trials. To support this claim, reports recently revealed that Perplexity AI Inc. offers free access to its premium plan through a partnership with telecom giant Bharti Airtel Ltd. On the other hand, Google, a subsidiary of Alphabet, provides its Gemini AI Pro membership free for students for one year.

The restructuring paves the way for the ChatGPT maker to more easily profit off its artificial intelligence technology even as it remains technically under the control of a nonprofit. Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings and California Attorney General Rob Bonta said in separate statements that they would not object to the proposal, seemingly bringing to an end more than a year of negotiations and announcements about the future of OpenAI's governance and the power that for-profit investors and its nonprofit board will have over the organization's technology. The company also said it has signed a new agreement with its longtime backer Microsoft that gives the software giant a roughly 27% stake in OpenAI's new for-profit corporation but changes some of the details of their close partnership. The attorneys general of Delaware, where OpenAI is incorporated, and California, where it is headquartered, had both said they’re investigating the proposed changes. “We will be keeping a close eye on OpenAI to ensure ongoing adherence to its charitable mission and the protection of the safety of all Californians,” said Bonta. OpenAI said it completed its restructuring “after nearly a year of engaging in constructive dialogue” with the offices in both states. “OpenAI has completed its recapitalization, simplifying its corporate structure,” said a blog post Tuesday from Bret Taylor, the chair of OpenAI's board of directors. “The nonprofit remains in control of the for-profit, and now has a direct path to major resources before AGI arrives.” AGI stands for artificial general intelligence, which OpenAI defines as “highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work.” OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit in 2015 with a mission to safely build AGI for humanity's benefit. It later started a for-profit arm. Microsoft invested its first $1 billion in OpenAI in 2019 and the two companies formed an agreement that made Microsoft the exclusive provider of the computing power needed to build OpenAI’s technology. In turn, Microsoft heavily used the technology behind ChatGPT to enhance its own AI products. The two companies first revealed in January that they were altering that agreement, enabling San Francisco-based OpenAI to build its own computing capacity, “primarily for research and training of models.” That coincided with OpenAI’s announcements of a partnership with Oracle and SoftBank to build a massive new data center in Abilene, Texas. It's since announced more such projects planned in the U. S., Asia, Europe and South America, along with big deals with chipmakers like Nvidia, AMD and Broadcom. But other parts of its agreements with Microsoft remained up in the air as the two companies appeared to veer further apart before reaching a tentative new agreement in September. OpenAI had previously said its own nonprofit board will decide when AGI is reached, effectively ending its Microsoft partnership. But it now says that “once AGI is declared by OpenAI, that declaration will now be verified by an independent expert panel,” and that Microsoft's rights to OpenAI's confidential research methods “will remain until either the expert panel verifies AGI or through 2030, whichever is first.” Microsoft will also retain some commercial rights to OpenAI products “post-AGI” and through 2032. Microsoft put out the same joint announcement about the revised partnership Tuesday but declined further comment. Its shares spiked 2% on Tuesday. Going forward, the nonprofit will be called the OpenAI Foundation and Taylor said it would grant out $25 billion toward health and curing diseases and protecting against the cybersecurity risks of AI. He did not say over what time period those funds would be dispersed. Robert Weissman, co-president of the nonprofit Public Citizen, said this arrangement does not guarantee the nonprofit independence, likening it to a corporate foundation that will serve the interests of the for profit. Even as the nonprofit’s board may technically remain in control, Weissman said that control “is illusory because there is no evidence of the nonprofit ever imposing its values on the for profit.” The Delaware attorney general’s investigation focused on ensuring OpenAI put its commitment to safety first and before any financial interests. Jennings also said OpenAI promised to keep its nonprofit in control of the public benefit corporation, including the right to appoint and remove its board members. The removal of OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman in Nov. 2023 by the nonprofit's board at the time and his subsequent reappointment kicked off the company's effort to restructure. The nonprofit’s board will continue to include a Safety and Security Committee, which will have the power “to oversee and review” OpenAI’s technology development. It will even have the power to stop the release of a new product, according to the Delaware attorney general’s statement. Additionally, within a year, the nonprofit’s board will include at least two members who do not also serve on the public benefit corporation’s board. OpenAI still faces a legal challenge from billionaire Tesla CEO Elon Musk, an early OpenAI investor who now runs his own AI firm, xAI, and has accused the startup he co-founded of betraying its original mission. A federal judge in March denied Musk’s request for a court order blocking OpenAI from converting itself to a for-profit company but said she could expedite a trial to consider Musk’s claims. -Matt O'Brien and Thalia Beaty.",2025-10-28 17:45:00+00:00,True,False

PayPal announced Tuesday that its digital payment system will be integrated into ChatGPT, inviting anyone who uses it to shop directly from the chatbot. Starting next year, ChatGPT users will be able to check out with a click through a PayPal account and connect directly with the tens of millions of sellers who rely on PayPal’s payments system. ""By partnering with OpenAI and adopting the Agentic Commerce Protocol, PayPal will power payments and commerce experiences that help people go from chat to checkout in just a few taps for our joint customer bases,” PayPal CEO Alex Chriss said in a press release. PayPal’s shares rose on the news, which was announced on the same day as the company’s quarterly earnings report. PayPal is all-in on an AI-focused future of online retail. Beyond the new ChatGPT plans, the company is “collaborating to create new AI shopping experiences” with Google and partnering on free premium trials with AI search engine Perplexity. Chriss said on Tuesday’s earnings call, adding that the company was better positioned than it was two years ago. “With differentiated competitive advantages, clear strategic direction and building execution momentum, we believe we are exceptionally well-placed to win into the future.” OpenAI’s shopping mall PayPal is the latest partner to join OpenAI’s e-commerce vision, but it isn’t the first. In September, ChatGPT’s parent company revealed that it would integrate Shopify and Etsy directly in what it described as “first steps toward agentic commerce” through an instant checkout platform built with Stripe. “ChatGPT doesn’t just help you find what to buy, it also helps you buy it,” OpenAI wrote in a blog post on the announcement. The Etsy integration is already live, surfacing U. S. Etsy sellers directly in response to prompts in chat, like “Find me blue and white teacups under $50.” The Shopify partnership will bring major retailers into the mix, with products from brands like Glossier, SKIMS and Vuori woven into the chat. Earlier this month, it struck a similar deal with Walmart. For OpenAI, aggressively gobbling up the market with ChatGPT has been the name of the game, not monetization. The “build first, profit later” method a Silicon Valley special has gone swimmingly for the AI company so far and it boasts more than 700 million weekly active users. OpenAI shot out of the gate with a buzzy free product, collecting loyal customers and funneling power users toward tiered premium subscriptions, though it actually loses money on some of those paid plans. For OpenAI, e-commerce is a logical next step for revenue. It’s also a direction that opens the door wide for advertising, which the company was one staunchly against but seems to be gravitating toward with recent hiring and its new corporate structure which was finalized this week. On the consumer side, the plunge into AI-powered shopping is poised to steer people away from Google as a first port of call and toward tailored results shaped by AI queries. That behavior shift is just one more way that AI continues to creep into every aspect of digital life, reshaping every interaction and transaction we make in the process.",2025-10-28 18:30:00+00:00,True,False

In Brief OpenAI transitions into a for-profit public benefit corporation to raise new capital. Microsoft secures a 27% stake valued at $135B and retains AI model access until 2032. OpenAI Foundation keeps 26% control to uphold the company’s mission on responsible AGI. OpenAI has officially transitioned into a public benefit corporation, finalising its shift from a capped-profit structure to a more conventional for-profit model. This move clears the path for the company to raise substantial capital and potentially pursue an initial public offering (IPO) in the coming years. The restructuring was approved by the attorneys general of California and Delaware, ending more than 18 months of internal planning. OpenAI will now operate through a new entity called OpenAI Group. This change allows traditional equity stakes and removes earlier constraints on investment returns that were tied to the nonprofit model. As part of the shift, Microsoft acquired a 27% stake in OpenAI, valued at $135 billion. In return, Microsoft gains access to OpenAI’s models until 2032 but gives up exclusive rights to provide cloud infrastructure. The company also relinquished its veto rights over acquisitions and securities issuance, simplifying OpenAI’s future dealmaking. Board Control, Governance, and Future Outlook Despite becoming a for-profit entity, OpenAI retains strong nonprofit oversight through the OpenAI Foundation, which will hold 26% of the new business and maintain exclusive rights to hire or remove board members. This setup ensures that OpenAI’s original mission to develop artificial general intelligence (AGI) for the benefit of humanity remains intact. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, remains on the board but has chosen not to take any equity in the restructured entity. Investors like SoftBank, Sequoia Capital, Thrive Capital, and Andreessen Horowitz can now hold equity, potentially benefitting from a future IPO. OpenAI is currently valued at $500 billion and continues to expand.",2025-10-28 23:44:07+00:00,True,False

Three years ago, Winston Weinberg found himself buried in these kinds of tasks as a first-year antitrust and litigation associate at O’Melveny & Myers in Los Angeles. And there Weinberg might have remained, diligently climbing the BigLaw ranks from associate to partner, logging thousands of hours of drudgery along the way. Instead, he’s cofounder and CEO of Harvey, the high-flying legal AI platform that’s raised more than $800 million by promising to handle much of this work. “A lot of the tasks junior [associates] do are going to get automated,” Weinberg says. “That doesn't mean their job's going to get automated. It's just going to be a different job.” Built atop language models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google, Harvey’s platform streamlines legal workflows by helping lawyers with drafting, contract analysis, legal research, due diligence, regulatory compliance, and case law review. In addition, the technology cuts down on reading time by summarizing complex legal documents and combining databases to research and summarize legal issues. Harvey, which is used by some 250 law firms-including 42% of The American Lawyer’s list of biggest 100 firms in the U. S.-announced in June that it raised a $300 million series D led by Sequoia, bringing its total haul to more than $800 million and driving its valuation to $5 billion. It’s now the highest valued startup in a growing field of AI companies that are all focused on overhauling how the legal profession works. The company’s annualized revenue run rate hit $100 million in August, up from $50 million earlier this year, propelled by an aggressive sales strategy targeting big law firms. Harvey now has 460 employees, 20% of whom are lawyers. The company is also hiring dozens of engineers, sales leads, and account executives as it seeks to increase the moat between itself and its competitors. Whether Harvey ultimately upends the legal procession or winds up burning a lot of cash, time, and effort could reveal that fates of industries as far afield as finance, music, and film. All these sectors-and more-are on a similar curve: exploring whether AI tools can be truly transformative and seeing just how many jobs they'll reimagine-or disappear altogether. Despite its sizable moat, Harvey's success is far from assured. Investors are pouring money into firms working on rival legal AI agents: Canada-based Clio raised $900 million last summer; Sweden’s Legora raised an $80 million Series B led by ICONIQ Venture & Growth and General Catalyst in September; London-based Luminance took in $75 million in January. Meanwhile, a growing chorus of critics-sounding off on Reddit and elsewhere-question how original Harvey’s offerings are. ""ChatGPT wrapper"" is the most common dig thrown by these disaffected apparent users, who note the similarities between the information retrieval capabilities of Harvey and ChatGPT (made by Harvey’s early investor, OpenAI). Even Harvey’s cofounders have called OpenAI an indirect competitor. But critics also say the company could be steamrolled by OpenAI, pointing out that the LLM could simply build its own legal-focused model. “I’m hearing from more and more attorneys that OpenAI’s Deep Research is the single best research product on the market, and it’s what most attorneys use (even when it’s not a firm approved tool),” former lawyer and legaltech investor Zack Abramowitz wrote on his popular substack Legally Disrupted in June. OpenAI itself has begun testing the waters of legal technology. In September, the company published a blog post about creating an internal database to review its own contracts-the feature is not available to consumers. One Redditor, who claimed to be a former employee, recently went even further, drawing a direct comparison to Silicon Valley’s most notorious startup: “think of theranos and overinflated claims of what a product can do,” the person posted in a thread that reached more than 300 of comments within a day. The post generated enough attention to prompt an indirect reply from Weinberg himself: On LinkedIn, he stated that the company’s Gross Revenue Retention (GRR) is at 98% and its Net Dollar Retention (NDR) is at 167-signs that Harvey is both retaining and growing revenue from its customers. The Redditor has since deleted their post, though comments agreeing with it remain on the page. (When Fast Company reached out to verify the person’s employment at Harvey, a spokesperson said: “There was nothing in the post to suggest that the author was a recent employee at the company.”) Harvey’s customers, in the meantime, seem satisfied. “[Harvey is] totally embedded in the workday of our lawyers. It's really become embedded throughout their daily workflows,” says Gina Lynch, chief knowledge and innovation officer at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, the white-shoe law firm with more than a thousand lawyers. (Pereyra is now president of Harvey.) In the spring of 2022, while Weinberg was working as a lawyer, Pereyra was focused on finding real-world, assistant-like applications for large language models. It didn’t take long before he and Weinberg started testing out Weinberg’s legal workflows on language models, most notably OpenAI’s GPT-3, which was publicly available. (The pair had initially started running GPT-3 to augment their Dungeons and Dragons games, but quickly realized the potential of its chain of thought prompting abilities.) They began using GPT-3 to solve problems on the r/legaladvice subreddit. “We found a hundred landlord-tenant questions and we were able to answer [them],” Weinberg says. To further test the model’s accuracy, they fed it legal materials about California regulations and local statutes, then got it to answer questions. “We showed [the answers] to three California-based lawyers working on landlord-tenant issues. We just said, ‘Would you send this to a client?’ For 86 out of 200 questions, at least two attorneys answered thumbs up,” Weinberg says. Their timing was auspicious. It was still months before the launch of ChatGPT would make GPT-3’s capabilities clear to everyone. In July 2022 Weinberg and Pereyra cold-emailed OpenAI’s general counsel at the time, Jason Kwon, and shared their ideas for how AI could change legal work (Kwon is now OpenAI’s chief strategy officer). In November of that year, the company raised $5 million from the LLM’s startup fund, along with venture capitalists Elad Gil and Sarah Guo (all three also participated in the company’s most recent round). Within five months, blue chip venture capital firms, including Sequoia, also invested. Signing on Big Law Almost as soon as it launched, Harvey aggressively began pursuing enterprise contracts with big law firms. In December 2022, A&O Shearman, which has nearly 4, 000 lawyers across 48 offices, started testing Harvey’s technology in its Markets Innovation Group. Paul Weiss followed in January 2023 and began testing the technology throughout its practice. Both firms have since signed longer contracts. Using those clients’ reputations, Harvey has signed big contracts with other prominent U. S. firms, including Vinson & Elkins and Macfarlanes. The company now has 700 customers in 58 countries. Other clients include general counsel offices at private equity firms and hedge funds like KKR and Bridgewater and accounting giant PwC. For bigger clients, Harvey embeds staff members within the company to personalize its services and features for their workflows. It also offers an off-the-shelf general application product for smaller companies. Harvey’s close association with OpenAI has, in some ways, been a blessing and a curse. The AI giant gave Harvey a first-mover advantage, but has heightened the comparisons between ChatGPT and Harvey. After all, according to a March survey from Law360, ChatGPT is the tool most lawyers use for work-even if it’s not approved by their firm. But although Harvey could still introduce hallucinations into its work (an issue that has bedeviled lawyers who rely too heavily on ChatGPT), it’s less likely to do so, says Weinberg, because it’s trained on legal data and purpose-built for corporate law firms. The company says that its 2024 version of Assistant, Harvey’s most popular product, reduces hallucinations by 60% and improves the accuracy of cited sources by 23% compared to other chatbots. Harvey has also deepened its product by incorporating models from Anthropic and Google alongside OpenAI’s GPT. It also recently signed a key deal with LexisNexis that enables users to ask complex legal questions and get citation-backed answers. Harvey, however, could find itself in a similar situation to Bloomberg’s ill-fated BloombergGPT as technology evolves. In 2023, the financial information giant Bloomberg spent more than $10 million training an LLM on its own financial data before finding out that an off-the-shelf GPT-4 provided more accurate answers to users. As Ethan Mollick, a professor and codirector of the Generative AI Lab at Wharton, wrote on Linkedin, “There was a moment that we thought proprietary data would let organizations train specialized AIs that could compete with frontier models. It turns out that probably isn't going to happen. The largest frontier models are just much better at most complex tasks than smaller models.” Another concern is how long Harvey can maintain its lead, given the cost of its product. Harvey’s bespoke services cost $1,200 per seat, per month, with contracts stipulating that large companies need to purchase the service for at least 100 employees and for at least a year. The company justifies its prices by touting the productivity gains it passes onto employees. “You can arm lawyers with tools that make them enormously productive,” says Harvey’s chief business officer John Haddock, who has a law degree from Stanford. And $100, 000 a month is still less expensive than the salaries of an army of paralegals and junior associates. Even so, Harvey will have to convince its customers to sign back up, even as more affordable products-aimed especially at smaller or midsized firms-enter the market. And it has to keep delivering for them amid an AI hype cycle where disappointment in enterprise AI products is growing. After the recent flare-up on Reddit involving the apparent former employee, Maarten Truyens, founder and CEO of ClauseBase, a Belgium startup also working on an AI platform for legal drafting, took to LinkedIn to weigh in. He said the main problem is the hype and expectations around these AI platforms. “GenAI is too good to ignore, yet simply not good enough for many legal use cases,” he wrote. “What's really needed is vendors to be transparent about the limitations, and the legal community to learn what's possible with GenAI, and where other technologies are a better fit. Both sides need to become much more realistic.” AI associates Though Harvey’s work needs to be checked-which can be a time-consuming process for paralegals and junior lawyers-the company aims to cut down their workload. A widely cited 2023 Thomson Reuters report estimated that AI technology could save lawyers on average 200 hours a year. That number has likely increased as AI becomes more sophisticated. Left unsaid: It could also cut down the number of lawyers and paralegals firms and companies need to hire. Investors and Harvey employees argue that legal tech is unlikely to take jobs away because the demand for legal services is likely to increase. “There's a huge undelivered need for legal services. The right way to think about it is that if you can arm lawyers with tools that make them enormously productive, that will just expand the access to the types of services they can provide,” Haddock says. Venture capitalist Sarah Guo, whose firm Conviction invested in Harvey in 2022, makes a similar argument: “People will not want less practice of the law. They will want more if it is more affordable, and the quality will go up.” Employment for law school graduates hit a record high in 2024, according to the American Bar Association. But the incentive structure for law firms is complicated. Most big firms bill hourly, and when a task that typically took a law associate hours of research can be condensed into three or four minutes, they face the prospect of losing money. One way to save: hiring fewer associates. Weinberg acknowledges that Harvey could change hiring. “Are there some firms that will change their business model and structure? Yes. I do think there are some firms that might explore [charging] fixed fees [rather than hourly billing] or having a leaner team,” he says. Corporate legal teams could see the most impact from Harvey. Allison Zoellner, general counsel at advertising giant Dentsu, which started working with Harvey last year, says that while the company’s AI tools haven’t led to a workforce reduction, she hasn’t had to hire as much. “We're being asked to do more with fewer resources. What Harvey does is allow us to keep our heads above water while not adding people.” Weinberg, Haddock, and Guo all say that by eliminating rote tasks, tools like Harvey will free up time for junior lawyers to attend meetings, shadow senior leaders, and start doing more strategic work. “So much of what an associate does today is the types of things that [are] not what they went to law school for. If we are able to give associates faster, thicker, deeper, higher-order thinking problems, that is great for everybody. It's great for partners who can get The legal industry has weathered technological shifts before. “When I started as a lawyer in the '90s, it was the time of transition from manual review of documents in litigation to computer-assisted review of documents. [That created] a bump in productivity,” NYU Law School professor Christopher Sprigman says. “How many more people would've been hired at those firms absent the introduction of that technology? There's always an unknowable counterfactual, but I get the strong idea that it’s fewer than [if the technology hadn’t been adopted].” These days, Sprigman says lawyers are having similar conversations. “A friend of mine who runs a law firm said to me that at this point, maybe 10 to 20% of what junior associates do can be automated through AI. But in 18 months it could be 30%,” he says. “The winners will be people who know how to use AI in their practice and also people who have deep expertise that allows them to exercise judgment.” It is too early to say how the technology will impact roles at the Paul, Weiss. Lynch expects that while it will not reduce positions at the company, it will bring change to certain roles. She has already seen wider acceptance by senior leadership than anticipated. “Partners very much gravitated towards AI because they were comfortable that they knew whether the output was good or bad.” More junior employees with less experience may not be able to make those distinctions early on in their careers. Already, Paul Weiss is using its AI savvy as a sales pitch to prospective clients. “We want [clients] to know we’re using it and we are really earnest about the efficiency gains,” Lynch says. Lynch and Sprigman see a new role emerging within law schools and firms that specializes in AI adoption. “You’re going to see more of a legal technologist role,” Lynch says, adding that, like many firms, Paul Weiss has invested heavily in training to get lawyers to use AI tools, and in building their own closed LLM to work alongside Harvey. Sprigman says that senior lawyers may start to look for AI savvy in their juniors, and that means law schools may also have to change. “Law schools obviously want their students to be prepared. [That could be] teaching people how to prompt engineer. Maybe that's something you hire an adjunct for. I'm sure school schools will be looking for expertise from the outside,” he says. To gain an edge and get students used to its platform, Harvey has started partnering with law schools including the University of Chicago and the University of Pennsylvania to offer students, professors, and administrators access to its tools. A sizable moat The moat of capital Harvey has raised, its aggressive and successful pursuit of leading law firms, and its relationship with OpenAI have made it a dominant player in the legal AI race. But the company’s valuation may limit its exit possibilities. “We're voting that the company has the opportunity to be a tens of billions of dollars public company,” Guo says. The company’s success may ultimately hinge on how many big law firms decide to renew their contracts with Harvey once the mandatory year or two minimum expires, and whether the company can stay ahead of competitors from rivals like Legora to off-the-shelf LLMs. Weinberg and Pereyra settled on the name Harvey because it sounds a little bit like Harvard and because of its associations with Suits’ superlawyer Harvey Specter. Ultimately though, Harvey acts more like the show’s other main character, Mike Ross, a college dropout with a photographic memory. Though he is unlicensed, Ross proves to be more useful to Specter than any other paralegal or associate at the fictional big law firm.",2025-10-29 11:00:00+00:00,True,True

The celebrity video service Cameo has filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, claiming the artificial intelligence company stole its name for a new feature in the Sora video app. Cameo brought the trademark lawsuit to a California federal court on Tuesday. The company says OpenAI's decision to call its feature ""cameo"" will hurt Cameo's reputation by making people think the brand is connected to ""ersatz, hastily made AI slop and deepfakes featuring celebrities."" Cameo started its app back in 2017. The service lets fans pay to get short custom videos or live video calls from famous people, social media stars, and other well-known personalities. As Cryptopolitan reported, OpenAI rolled out its Sora app on September 30th. The app makes AI videos and has a feature called ""cameo"" that creates deepfake copies of users that others can put in their videos. While some celebrities have agreed to upload their faces to the feature, the app's weak safety measures have allowed people to make unauthorized deepfakes of others. Cameo tried a private settlement first Steven Galanis, who runs Cameo as CEO, said his company tried to work things out privately first. ""We do not take litigation lightly. While we attempted to resolve this matter with OpenAI amicably, they refused to stop using the Cameo name for their new Sora feature,"" Galanis told The Verge. ""To protect fans, talent, and the integrity of our marketplace, we felt that we unfortunately had no other option but to bring this lawsuit."" In court papers, Cameo argues that OpenAI picked the name ""cameo"" on purpose to ride on the good reputation Cameo built up since its start. The company also pointed out that several websites have popped up focusing on Sora's cameo feature, which damages Cameo's trademark even more. OpenAI pushed back against the accusations.

Microsoft declined to comment beyond confirming that the $3. 1 billion loss “this year” referred to Microsoft’s current fiscal year, which started July 1, not the calendar year. So that’s a quarterly loss, not a nine-month loss. That’s a humongous number for OpenAI given it reportedly generated only $4. 3 billion in revenue for the first half of the year, but a sum that won’t hurt Big Daddy Redmond too much given it earned $27. 7 billion in net income in the last quarter alone.

Amazon shares soared nearly 12% in premarket trading on Friday after the company reported strong growth at its cloud unit and a bullish sales outlook, easing fears that the tech giant was falling behind its rivals in the AI race. Revenue at Amazon Web Services, the hub of the company's recent AI investments, rose 20% in the third quarter.

This was higher than the $32. 42 billion, representing an 18. 1% growth from the previous year, as expected by analysts polled by StreetAccount. As reported by Cryptopolitan, the company also posted $180. 2 billion in revenue, up 13% year-over-year, and $1. 95 earnings per share, surpassing the $1. 57 EPS analysts had expected.

In brief You can give local AI models web access using free Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers-no corporate APIs, no data leaks, no fees. Setup is simple: Install LM Studio, add Brave, Tavily, or DuckDuckGo MCP configs, and your offline model becomes a private SearchGPT. The result: real-time browsing, article analysis, and data fetching-without ever touching OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google’s clouds. So you want an AI that can browse the web and think the only options are from OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google? Think again. Your data doesn't need to travel through corporate servers every time your AI assistant needs timely information. With Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, you can give even lightweight consumer models the ability to search the web, analyze articles, and access real-time data-all while maintaining complete privacy and spending zero dollars. The catch? There isn't one. These tools offer generous free tiers: Brave Search provides 2, 000 queries monthly, Tavily offers 1, 000 credits, and certain options require no API key at all. For most users, that's enough runway to never hit a limit. you don’t make 1, 000 searches in one day. Before going technical, two concepts need explanation. ""Model Context Protocol"" is an open standard released by Anthropic in November 2024 that allows AI models to connect with external tools and data sources. Think of it as a kind of universal adapter that connects Tinkeryoy-like modules that add utility and functionality to your AI model. ﻿ Instead of telling your AI exactly what to do (which is what an API call does), you tell the model what you need and it just sort of figures out on its own what to do to achieve that goal. MCPs are not as accurate as traditional API calls, and you’ll likely spend more tokens to make them work, but they are.",2025-11-03 19:48:14+00:00,True,True

Specifically, the deal was between OpenAI and Amazon Web Services, the company’s cloud computing business.

In brief Ilya Sutskever prepared a 52-page case against Sam Altman based almost entirely on unverified claims from one source-CTO Mira Murati OpenAI came within days of merging with competitor Anthropic during the crisis, with board member Helen Toner arguing that destroying the company could be “consistent with the mission” The board was “rushed” and “inexperienced,” according to Ilya himself, who had been planning Altman’s removal for at least a year while waiting for favorable board dynamics Ilya Sutskever sat for nearly 10 hours of videotaped testimony in the Musk v. Altman lawsuit, back on October 1 of this year. The co-founder who helped build ChatGPT and became infamous for voting to fire Sam Altman in November 2023 was finally under oath and compelled to answer. The 365-page transcript was released this week. What it reveals is a portrait of brilliant scientists making catastrophic governance decisions, unverified allegations treated as facts, and ideological divides so deep that some board members preferred destroying OpenAI rather than letting it continue under Altman’s leadership. ﻿ The Musk v. Altman lawsuit centers on Elon Musk’s claim that OpenAI and its CEO, Altman, betrayed the company’s original nonprofit mission by turning its research into a for-profit venture aligned with Microsoft-raising high-stakes questions about who controls advanced AI models and whether they can be developed safely in the public interest. For those following the OpenAI drama, the document is an eye-opening and damning read. It’s a case study in how things go wrong when technical genius meets organizational incompetence.

Jessie A Ellis Nov 04, 2025 21: 35 Anthropic endorses California’s SB 53, a bill aiming to regulate powerful AI systems through safety frameworks and transparency, setting a precedent for AI governance. Anthropic has announced its endorsement of California’s SB 53, a legislative proposal focused on regulating powerful artificial intelligence systems developed by leading AI companies, according to Anthropic. This endorsement follows Anthropic’s ongoing advocacy for thoughtful AI regulation, aiming to address the challenges posed by advanced AI technologies. Details of SB 53 SB 53, introduced by Senator Scott Wiener, seeks to implement a ‘trust but verify’ approach to AI governance. This includes requiring large AI developers to publish safety frameworks and transparency reports, detailing how they manage and mitigate potential risks associated with their systems. The bill also mandates the reporting of critical safety incidents and provides whistleblower protections. These measures are designed to ensure accountability and transparency in the development and deployment of powerful AI models. Anthropic, along with other major AI developers like Google DeepMind, OpenAI, and Microsoft, already follows similar practices. The proposed legislation aims to formalize these standards, particularly for large companies, while exempting smaller entities to avoid unnecessary regulatory burdens. Impact on AI Safety By enforcing transparency requirements, SB 53 aims to prevent competitive pressures from undermining safety and disclosure efforts among AI developers. The bill ensures that all AI capabilities posing risks to public safety are disclosed, thereby creating a level playing field where transparency is not optional but a legal requirement. Future Considerations While SB 53 lays a solid foundation for AI regulation, Anthropic highlights areas for further development. These include more detailed requirements for testing and evaluation of AI systems, and the ability for regulations to evolve with technological advancements.

Microsoft is officially building superintelligence, and it’s not waiting for anyone’s permission anymore. The company made the announcement Thursday, saying it has formed a new group, the MAI Superintelligence Team under Mustafa Suleyman, who now leads Microsoft’s AI division. The goal is not just to match human intelligence with machines, but to push way beyond it. According to Bloomberg, the company now wants to create AI systems that can outperform humans across every field, including health care, clean energy, and materials science. Mustafa said in a blog post that AGI (artificial general intelligence) is when AI can do anything a human can. But he added that superintelligence goes “far beyond that performance.” He said the new mission is to build what he calls Humanist Superintelligence, a system designed to serve people directly rather than chasing tech milestones. He named personal AI assistants, better medical outcomes, and sustainable energy solutions as real-world targets. The company previously wasn’t allowed to chase AGI, based on a restriction from its original deal with OpenAI, but that clause is now gone. Microsoft forms new team after scrapping AI restriction The updated contract between Microsoft and OpenAI removed the restriction that had kept Microsoft boxed into less powerful models. The new agreement also gives the tech company a 27% stake in OpenAI’s public-benefit company, letting it now work independently on AGI and more advanced tools. The changes come as the two firms shift from full collaboration to what looks more like strategic rivalry. Mustafa, who’s 41 years old, joined Microsoft in 2024 after leaving Inflection AI, a startup he co-founded. Microsoft licensed Inflection’s intellectual property and brought him on board to help shape its future in AI. Since then, Mustafa has reorganized internal teams, moved key Microsoft AI staff into the new group, and hired people.",2025-11-06 23:50:15+00:00,True,False

Key Points: Sam Altman clarifies OpenAI’s stance on government backstops. OpenAI focuses on self-sufficiency. AI infrastructure expansion continues without federal aid. On November 7, 2025, OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman announced that the company does not seek U. S. government support for its data centers, emphasizing market-driven solutions. This stance highlights potential shifts in AI infrastructure funding, with OpenAI projecting massive revenue growth and rejecting government intervention in favor of self-reliance. Sam Altman Rejects Government Backstop for OpenAI Projects Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, publicly announced that OpenAI does not want or need federal government backstops for its extensive data center infrastructure. Altman emphasized that government roles should not include picking industry winners or bailing out companies. OpenAI projects its annual revenue to surpass $20 billion this year, targeting ambitious growth to hundreds of billions by 2030, with $1. 4 trillion committed to data center development over eight years. “We do not have or want government guarantees for OpenAI datacenters. We believe that governments should not pick winners or losers, and that taxpayers should not bail out companies that make bad business decisions or otherwise lose in the market,” said Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI. David Sacks, White House AI & crypto czar, remarked on the diversity of companies like Nvidia, AMD, and Oracle in maintaining innovation without specific bailouts. The absence of notable responses from major crypto leaders or regulatory bodies indicates a cautious market currently detached from OpenAI’s infrastructure strategies.

S. support amid restructuring and funding challenges. OpenAI Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman was served with a subpoena during a live discussion with Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr at the Sydney Goldstein Theater in San Francisco. The event, hosted by civic leader Manny Yekutiel, was interrupted when a man from the audience jumped on stage claiming to deliver a subpoena. Yekutiel stepped in to block the individual before security escorted him away. The document was handed to theater staff, and the program resumed after a short pause. The San Francisco Public Defender’s Office later confirmed that the man was one of its investigators and had legally served Altman. Spokesperson Valerie Ibarra told SFGATE that Altman was named as a witness in an ongoing criminal case after earlier attempts to reach him at OpenAI’s headquarters and online failed.

According to the US-based AI company, most of the world still thinks about AI as chatbots and better search.“But today, we have systems that can outperform the smartest humans at some of our most challenging intellectual competitions. Although AI systems are still spikey and face serious weaknesses, systems that can solve such hard problems seem more like 80 per cent of the way to an AI researcher than 20 per cent of the way,” according to OpenAI. The gap between how most people are using AI and what AI is presently capable of is immense. Also, AI systems that can discover new knowledge either autonomously, or by making people more effective are likely to have a significant impact on the world. According to OpenAI, in just a few years, AI has gone from only being able to do tasks (in the realm of software engineering specifically) that a person can do in a few seconds to tasks that take a person more than an hour.“We expect to have systems that can do tasks that take a person days or weeks soon; we do not know how to think about systems that can do tasks that would take a person centuries. At the same time, the cost per unit of a given level of intelligence has fallen steeply; 40x per year is a reasonable estimate over the last few years,” it mentioned in a blog post. Soon, AI systems will help people understand their health, accelerate progress in fields like materials science, drug development, and climate modelling, and expand access to personalised education for students around the world. Demonstrating these kinds of tangible benefits helps build a shared vision of a world where AI can make life better, not just more efficient.“Although the potential upsides are enormous, we treat the risks of superintelligent systems as potentially catastrophic and believe that empirically studying safety and alignment can help global decisions, like whether the whole field should slow development to more carefully study these systems as we get closer to systems capable of recursive self-improvement,” the company noted. Obviously, no one should deploy super-intelligent systems without being able to robustly align and control them, and this requires more technical work, it added.",2025-11-09 07:03:49+00:00,True,False

Softbank has unveiled plans to continue pushing into AI with investments in PayPay, ChatGPT, and OpenAI, helping it gain $19 billion on its Vision Fund in Q2. The Japanese conglomerate is investing in or acquiring firms that will fortify its presence in ASI (Artificial Super Intelligence) and robotics. Softbank stated in its earnings statement on November 11 that it plans to invest an additional $22. 5 billion in OpenAI through its Vision Fund 2 in December. Last month, the company reportedly approved its final tranche of funding to complete its $30 billion investment in OpenAI. Softbank gained $14 billion (~¥2. 157T) in the quarter from its investment in OpenAI. It disclosed that AI revenue reached new highs in the quarter ended September 30, with 93% of annualized growth. The Japanese giant also said today that it will conduct a four-for-one stock split at the end of the year.

In brief SoftBank sold its entire 32. 1 million-share Nvidia position for $5. 83 billion in October, marking the second time the firm has exited the AI chipmaker. The asset sales are funding SoftBank’s investment in OpenAI, with $22. 5 billion scheduled to close in December following an October agreement amendment. “As SoftBank’s investment in OpenAI was very large the company had to use its existing assets to finance new investments,” CFO Yoshimitsu Goto told reporters. SoftBank Group sold all its shares in Nvidia in October, severing ties with the AI chipmaker that powered the sector’s historic rally. The Japanese conglomerate is redirecting capital toward OpenAI, even as the ChatGPT maker faces mounting losses and its CEO’s credibility comes under fire. The Tokyo-based firm disclosed the complete exit from Nvidia in its financial filing Tuesday, revealing that it and an asset management subsidiary “sold all of Nvidia Corporation shares that they had owned, for $5. 83 billion.” The move came alongside a $9. 17 billion partial sale of its T-Mobile stake, part of an “asset monetization” to fund a $40 billion investment in OpenAI by year-end. The sale comes as Wall Street questions whether AI infrastructure spending will pay off and as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman faces scrutiny for publicly denying he sought federal loan guarantees just days after his company explicitly requested them in a letter to the White House. SoftBank’s Vision Fund posted a blowout investment gain of $23. 4 billion (¥3. 54 trillion) for the quarter, $14. 3 billion (¥2. 16 trillion) of which came from marking up its OpenAI holdings to a pre-money valuation of $260 billion. The gains helped the company more than double net income to $19. 3 billion (¥2. 924 trillion), up 190. 9% from the previous year. The Nvidia sale marks SoftBank’s second exit from the chipmaker, after an initial $4 billion stake bought.",2025-11-11 19:17:07+00:00,True,False

OpenAI is about to test how far ambition can go before it melts the servers. Analysts at Citi said this week that the company will need to spend more than $1 trillion over the next five years to meet the insane level of computing power it has promised to build. The number is based on OpenAI’s partnerships with Nvidia, Broadcom, and AMD, which together aim to deliver a jaw‑dropping 26 gigawatts of compute capacity, roughly equal to powering the entire state of New York during a summer heatwave. According to Citi analyst Chris Danely, it costs about $50 billion to bring one gigawatt of compute online. Multiply that by 26, and OpenAI’s bill rockets to about $1. 3 trillion by 2030. The figure doesn’t even include the wilder plan that CEO Sam Altman has been floating behind closed doors. In late September, The Information reported that Sam has talked about ramping up to 250 gigawatts of compute capacity by 2033, a scale that would swallow about $12. 5 trillion in spending if ever attempted. Analysts warn of funding gap and AI market bubble The problem isn’t just the price tag. Citi estimates that even as OpenAI’s costs climb above a trillion dollars, its revenue might only reach $163 billion by 2030, which is only a fraction of what’s needed to cover that mountain of spending. That mismatch has made Wall Street nervous, especially as AI stocks keep pushing to new records this year. Investors are betting big on artificial intelligence, but analysts warn the hype could be building another market bubble. To make matters worse, it’s not clear if OpenAI even has the capital or access to enough power infrastructure to turn all this into reality. The United States’ electrical grid is already under pressure, and analysts say scaling it up fast.",2025-11-12 13:29:20+00:00,True,False

S. AI data centers with new sites com. Anthropic said Wednesday it’s investing $50 billion into building AI data centers across the United States, starting with two major custom sites in Texas and New York, according to a press release. The facilities, which are part of the company’s wider push to stay competitive in the AI infrastructure war, are being built in partnership with Fluidstack, an AI cloud firm that already powers GPU compute for clients like Meta, Midjourney, and Mistral. The buildout will kick off immediately, with both locations expected to go live in 2026. This isn’t some small pilot project. Anthropic is building facilities designed to handle gigawatts of power, focused entirely on training and running its AI models at scale. The company is targeting its enterprise clients, the ones responsible for most of its revenue, and these new sites are built to match the size of that demand. Dario Amodei, the company’s CEO, said the goal is to push forward on developing systems that can “solve complex problems” and “drive scientific discovery,” but that none of it is possible without physical infrastructure to support that growth. “These sites will help us build more capable AI systems that can drive those breakthroughs, while creating American jobs,” Dario said. Texas and New York break ground as Anthropic’s AI race accelerates The plan includes 800 permanent jobs and more than 2, 000 roles in construction, with even more locations expected to follow later. By launching these new facilities inside the U. S., Anthropic is responding directly to Washington’s growing demand for domestic compute power. There’s been rising pressure from federal officials and industry watchers to bring more AI infrastructure back onshore, especially as concerns grow about tech dependence on overseas suppliers. While Anthropic is expanding, its rival OpenAI is already deep into its own buildout. That company has lined up more.",2025-11-12 18:50:15+00:00,True,True

Microsoft also on Wednesday announced a new data center under construction in Atlanta, Georgia, describing it as connected to another in Wisconsin to form a “massive supercomputer” running on hundreds of thousands of Nvidia chips to power AI technology. The latest deals show that the tech industry is moving forward on huge spending to build energy-hungry AI infrastructure, despite lingering financial concerns about a bubble, environmental considerations, and the political effects of fast-rising electricity bills in the communities where they’re constructed. Anthropic, maker of the chatbot Claude, said it is working with London-based Fluidstack to build the new computing facilities to power its AI systems. It didn’t disclose their exact locations or what source of electricity they will need. Another company, cryptocurrency mining data center developer TeraWulf, has previously revealed it was working with Fluidstack on Google-backed data center projects in Texas and New York, on the shore of Lake Ontario. TeraWulf declined comment Wednesday. A report last month from TD Cowen said that the leading cloud computing providers leased a “staggering” amount of U. S. data center capacity in the third fiscal quarter of this year, amounting to more than 7. 4 gigawatts of energy, more than all of last year combined. Oracle was securing the most capacity during that time, much of it supporting AI workloads for Anthropic’s chief rival OpenAI, maker of ChatGPT. Google was second and Fluidstack came in third, ahead of Meta, Amazon, CoreWeave, and Microsoft. Anthropic said its projects will create about 800 permanent jobs and 2, 400 construction jobs. It said in a statement that the “scale of this investment is necessary to meet the growing demand for Claude from hundreds of thousands of businesses while keeping our research at the frontier.” Microsoft has branded its Atlanta data center as Fairwater 2, after the original Fairwater complex being built near Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The company said it will help power its own technology, along with OpenAI’s and other AI developers. Microsoft was, until earlier this year, OpenAI’s exclusive cloud computing provider before the two companies amended their partnership. OpenAI has since announced more than $1 trillion in infrastructure obligations, much of it tied to its Stargate project with partners Oracle and SoftBank. The tech industry’s huge amount of spending on computing infrastructure for AI startups that aren’t yet profitable has fueled concerns about an AI investment bubble. Investors have closely watched a series of intertwined deals over recent months between top AI developers such as OpenAI and Anthropic and the companies building the costly computer chips and data centers needed to power their AI products. Anthropic said it will continue to “prioritize cost-effective, capital-efficient approaches” to scaling up its business. -Matt O’Brien, AP technology writer.",2025-11-12 21:45:00+00:00,True,True

Expect fewer hallucinations, better, more creative writing, and more naughty bits",Fast Company,https://www.fastcompany.com/91439564/openai-gpt5-1-release-expectations?partner=rss&utm_content=rss,"OpenAI watchers have spotted something curious over the last week. References to GPT-5. 1 keep showing up in OpenAI’s codebase, and a “cloaked” model codenamed Polaris Alpha and widely believed to have come from OpenAI randomly appeared in OpenRouter, a platform that AI nerds use to test new systems. Nothing is official yet. But all of this suggests that OpenAI is quietly preparing to release a new version of their GPT-5 model. Industry sources point to a potential release date as early as November 24. If GPT-5. 1 is for real, what new capabilities will the model have? As a former OpenAI Beta tester-and someone who burns through millions of GPT-5 tokens every month-here’s what I’m expecting. A larger context window (but still not large enough) An AI model’s context window is the amount of data (measured in tokens, which are basically bits of words) that it can process at one time. As the name implies, a larger context window means that a model can consider more context and external information when processing a given request. This usually results in better output. I recently spoke to an artist, for example, who hands Google’s Gemini a 300-page document every time he chats with it. The document includes excerpts from his personal journal, full copies of screenplays he’s written, and much else. This insanely large amount of context lets the model provide him much better, more tailored responses than it would if he simply interacted with it like the average user. This works largely because Gemini has a 1 million token context window. GPT-5’s, in comparison, is relatively puny at just 196, 000 tokens in ChatGPT (expanded to 400, 000 tokens when used by developers through the company’s API). That smaller context window puts GPT-5 and ChatGPT at a major disadvantage. If you want to use the model to edit a book or improve a large codebase, for example, you’ll quickly run out of tokens. When OpenAI releases GPT-5. That’s better than today’s GPT-5, to be sure. But it still falls far short of Gemini-especially as Google prepares to make its own upgrades. OpenAI could make a surprise last-minute upgrade to 1 million tokens. But if it keeps the 256, 000 token context window, expect plenty of grumbling from the developer community about why the window still isn’t big enough. Even fewer hallucinations OpenAI’s GPT-5 model falls short in many ways. But one thing it’s very good at is providing accurate, largely hallucination-free responses. I often use OpenAI’s models to perform research. With earlier models like GPT-4o, I found that I had to carefully fact-check everything the model produced to ensure it wasn’t imagining some new software tool that doesn’t actually exist, or lying to me about myriad other small, crucial things. With GPT-5, I find I have to do that far less. The model isn’t perfect. But OpenAI has largely solved the problem of wild hallucinations. According to the company’s own data, GPT-5 hallucinates only 26% of the time when solving a complex benchmark problem, versus 75% of the time with older models. In normal usage, that translates to a far lower hallucination rate on simpler, everyday queries that aren’t designed to trip the model up. With GPT-5. 1, expect OpenAI to double down on its new, hallucination-free direction. The updated model is likely to do an even better job at avoiding errors. There’s a cost, though. Models that hallucinate less tend to take fewer risks, and can thus seem less creative than unconstrained, hallucination-laden ones. OpenAI will likely try to carefully walk the link between accuracy and creativity with GPT-5. 1. But there’s no guarantee they’ll succeed. Better, more creative writing In a similar vein, when OpenAI released their GPT-5 model, users quickly noticed that it produced boring, lifeless prose. At the time, I predicted that OpenAI had essentially given the model an “emotional lobotomy,” killing its emotional intelligence in order to curb a worrying trend of the model sending users down psychotic spirals. Turns out, I was right. In a post on X last month, Sam Altman admitted that “We made ChatGPT pretty restrictive to make sure we were being careful with mental health issues.” But Altman also said in the post “now that we have been able to mitigate the serious mental health issues and have new tools, we are going to be able to safely relax the restrictions in most cases.” That process began with the rollout of new, more emotionally intelligent personalities in the existing GPT-5 model. But it’s likely to continue and intensify with GPT-5. 1. I expect the new model to have the overall intelligence and accuracy of GPT-5, but with a personality to match the emotionally deep GPT-4o. This will likely be paired with much more robust safeguards to ensure that 5. 1 avoids conversations that might hurt someone who is having a mental health crisis. Hopefully, with GPT-5. 1 the company can protect those vulnerable users without bricking the bot’s brain for everyone else. Naughty bits If you’re squeamish about NSFW stuff, maybe cover your ears for this part. In the same X post, Altman subtly dropped a sentence that sent the Internet into a tizzy: “As we roll out age-gating more fully and as part of our ‘treat adult users like adults’ principle, we will allow even more, like erotica for verified adults.” The idea of America’s leading AI company churning out reams of computer-generated erotica has already sparked feverish commentary from such varied sources as politicians, Christian leaders, tech reporters, and (judging from the number of Upvotes), much of Reddit. For their part, though, OpenAI seems quite committed to moving ahead with this promise. In a calculus that surely makes sense in the strange techno-Libertarian circles of the AI world, the issue is intimately tied to personal freedom and autonomy. In a recent article about the future of artificial intelligence, OpenAI again reiterated that “We believe that adults should be able to use AI on their own terms, within broad bounds defined by society,” placing full access to AI “on par with electricity, clean water, or food.” All that’s to say that with the release of GPT-5. 1 (or perhaps slightly after the release, so the inevitable media frenzy doesn’t overshadow the new model’s less interesting aspects), the guardrails around ChatGPT’s naughty bits are almost certainly coming off. Deeper thought In addition to killing GPT-5’s emotional intelligence, OpenAI made another misstep when releasing GPT-5. The company tried to unify all queries within a single model, letting ChatGPT itself choose whether to use a simpler, lower-effort version of GPT-5, or a slower, more thoughtful one. The idea was noble-there’s little reason to use an incredibly powerful, slow, resource-intensive LLM to answer a query like, “Is tahini still good after one month in the fridge?” But in practice, the feature was a failure. ChatGPT was no good at determining how much effort was needed to field a given query, which meant that people asking complex questions were often routed to a cheap, crappy model that gave awful results. OpenAI fixed the issue in ChatGPT with a user interface kludge. But with GPT-5. 1, early indications point to OpenAI once again bifurcating their model into Instant and Thinking versions. The former will likely respond to simple queries far faster than GPT-5, while the latter will take longer, chew through more tokens, and yield better results on complex tasks. Crucially, it seems like the user will once again be able to explicitly choose between the two models. That should yield faster results when a query is genuinely simple, and a better ability to solve complicated problems. OpenAI has hinted that its future models will be “capable of making very small discoveries” in fields like science and medicine next year, with “systems that can make more significant discoveries” coming as soon as 2028. GPT-5. 1 will likely be a first step down that path. An attempt to course correct Until OpenAI formally releases GPT-5. 1 in one of its signature, wonky livestreams, all of this remains speculative. But given my history with OpenAI-going back to the halcyon days of GPT-3-these are some changes I’m expecting when the 5. 1 model does go live. Overall, GPT-5. 1 seems like an attempt to correct many of the glaring problems with GPT-5, while also doubling down on OpenAI’s more freedom-oriented, accuracy-focused approach. The new model will likely be able to think, (ahem) “flirt,” write, and communicate better than its predecessors. Whether it will do those things better than a growing stable of competing models from Google, Anthropic, and myriad Chinese AI labs, though, is anyone’s guess.",2025-11-13 10:00:00+00:00,True,True
79375b76-b298-4365-9ad7-6e6cd03f70c5,5 things to know about OpenAI’s new GPT-5.1,Fast Company,https://www.fastcompany.com/91439564/5-things-know-about-openais-new-gpt-5-1?partner=rss&utm_content=rss,"All last week, OpenAI watchers reported seeing strange things. References to GPT-5. 1 kept showing up in OpenAI’s codebase, and a “cloaked” model codenamed Polaris Alpha and widely believed to have come from OpenAI randomly appeared in OpenRouter, a platform that AI nerds use to test new systems. Today, we learned what was going on. OpenAI announced the release of its brand new 5. 1 model, an updated and revamped version of the GPT-5 model the company debuted in August. As a former OpenAI Beta tester-and someone who burns through millions of GPT-5 tokens every month-here’s what you need to know about GPT-5. 1. A smarter, friendlier robot In their release notes for the new model, OpenAI emphasizes that GPT-5. 1 is “smarter” and “more conversational” than previous versions. The company says that GPT-5. 1 is “warmer by default” and “often surprises people with its playfulness while remaining clear and useful.” While some people like talking with a chatbot as if it’s their long-time friend, others find that cringey. OpenAI acknowledges this, saying that “Preferences on chat style vary-from person to person and even from conversation to conversation.” For that reason, OpenAI says users can customize the new model’s tone, choosing between pre-set options like “Professional,” “Candid” and “Quirky.” There’s also a “Nerdy” option, which in my testing seems to make the model more pedantic and cause it to overuse terms like “level up.” At their core, the new changes feel like a pivot towards the consumer side of OpenAI’s customer base. Enterprise users probably don’t want a model that occasionally drops Dungeons and Dragons references. As the uproar over OpenAI’s initially voiceless GPT-5 model shows, though, everyday users do. Even fewer hallucinations OpenAI’s GPT-5 model fell short in many ways, but it was very good at providing accurate, largely hallucination-free responses. I often use OpenAI’s models to perform research. With earlier models like GPT-4o, I found that I had to carefully fact check everything the model produced to ensure it wasn’t imagining some new software tool that doesn’t actually exist, or lying to me about myriad other small, crucial things. With GPT-5, I had to do that far less. The model wasn’t perfect. But OpenAI had largely solved the problem of wild hallucinations. According to the company’s own data, GPT-5 hallucinates only 26% of the time when solving a complex benchmark problem, versus 75% of the time with older models. In normal usage, that translates to a far lower hallucination rate on simpler, everyday queries that aren’t designed to trip the model up. From my early testing, GPT-5. 1 seems even less prone to hallucinate. I asked it to make a list of the best restaurants in my hometown, and to include addresses, website links and open hours for each one. When I asked GPT-4 to complete a similar task years ago, it made up plausible-sounding restaurants that don’t exist. GPT-5 does better on such things, but still often misses details, like the fact that one popular restaurant recently moved down the street. GPT-5. 1’s list, though, is spot-on. Its choices are solid, they’re all real places, and the hours and locations are correct across all ten selections. There’s a cost, though. Models that hallucinate less tend to take fewer risks, and can thus seem less creative than unconstrained, hallucination-laden ones. To that point, the restaurants in GPT-5. 1’s list aren’t wrong, but they’re mostly safe choices-the kinds of places that have been in town forever, and that every local would have visited a million times. A real human reviewer (or a bolder model) might have highlighted a promising newcomer, just to keep things fresh and interesting. GPT-5. 1 stuck with decade-old, proven classics. OpenAI will likely try to carefully walk the link between accuracy and creativity with GPT-5. 1 as the rollout continues. The model clearly gets things right more often, but it’s not yet clear if that will impact GPT-5. 1’s ability to come up with things that are truly creative and new. Better, more creative writing In a similar vein, when OpenAI released their GPT-5 model, users quickly noticed that it produced boring, lifeless written prose. At the time, I predicted that OpenAI had essentially given the model an “emotional lobotomy,” killing its emotional intelligence in order to curb a worrying trend of the model sending users down psychotic spirals. Turns out, I was right. In a post on X last month, Sam Altman admitted that “We made ChatGPT pretty restrictive to make sure we were being careful with mental health issues.” But Altman also said in the post “now that we have been able to mitigate the serious mental health issues and have new tools, we are going to be able to safely relax the restrictions in most cases.” That process began with the rollout of new, more emotionally intelligent personalities in the existing GPT-5 model. But it’s continuing and intensifying with GPT-5. 1. Again, the model is already voicer than its predecessor. But as the system card for the new model shows, GPT-5. 1’s Instant model (the default in the popular free version of the ChatGPT app) is also markedly better at detecting harmful conversations and protecting vulnerable users. Naughty bits If you’re squeamish about NSFW stuff, maybe cover your ears for this part. In the same X post, Altman subtly dropped a sentence that sent the Internet into a tizzy: “As we roll out age-gating more fully and as part of our “treat adult users like adults” principle, we will allow even more, like erotica for verified adults.” The idea of America’s leading AI company churning out reams of computer-generated erotica has already sparked feverish commentary from such varied sources as politicians, Christian leaders, tech reporters, and (judging from the number of Upvotes), most of Reddit. For their part, though, OpenAI seems quite committed to moving ahead with this promise. In a calculus that surely makes sense in the strange techno-Libertarian circles of the AI world, the issue is intimately tied to personal freedom and autonomy. In a recent article about the future of artificial intelligence, OpenAI again reiterated that “We believe that adults should be able to use AI on their own terms, within broad bounds defined by society,” placing full access to AI “on par with electricity, clean water, or food.” All that’s to say that soon, the guardrails around ChatGPT’s naughty bits are almost certainly coming off. That hasn’t yet happened at launch-the model still coyly demures when asked about explicit things. But along with GPT-5. 1’s bolder personalities, it’s almost certainly on the way. Deeper thought In addition to killing GPT-5’s emotional intelligence, OpenAI made another misstep when releasing GPT-5. The company tried to unify all queries within a single model, letting ChatGPT itself choose whether to use a simpler, lower-effort version of GPT-5, or a slower, more thoughtful one. The idea was noble-there’s little reason to use an incredibly powerful, slow, resource-intensive LLM to answer a query like “Is tahini still good after 1 month in the fridge” (Answer: no) But in practice, the feature was a failure. ChatGPT was no good at determining how much effort was needed to field a given query, which meant that people asking complex questions were often routed to a cheap, crappy model that gave awful results. OpenAI fixed the issue in ChatGPT with a user interface kludge. But with GPT-5. 1, OpenAI is once again bifurcating their model into an Instant and Thinking version. The former responds to simple queries far faster than GPT-5, while the latter takes longer, chews through more tokens, and yields better results on complex tasks. OpenAI says that there’s more fine grained nuance within GPT-5. 1’s Thinking model, too. Unlike with GPT-5, the new model can dial up and down its level of thought to accurately answer tough questions without taking forever to return a response-a common gripe with the previous version. OpenAI has also hinted that its future models will be “capable of making very small discoveries” in fields like science and medicine next year, with “systems that can make more significant discoveries” coming as soon as 2028. GPT-5. 1’s increased smarts and dialed-up thinking ability are a first step down that path. An attempt to course correct Overall, GPT-5. 1 seems like an attempt to correct many of the glaring problems with GPT-5, while also doubling down on OpenAI’s more freedom-oriented, accuracy-focused, voicy approach to conversational AI. The new model can think, write, and communicate better than its predecessors-and will soon likely be able to (ahem) “flirt” better too.

Elon Musk’s XCorp and xAI won their key procedural battle on Thursday in the lawsuit against Apple Inc. and OpenAI. A federal judge in Texas has ordered Apple and OpenAI to respond to allegations that the two companies conspired to reduce competition in emerging markets for artificial intelligence. U. S. District Judge Mark Pittman of the Northern District of Texas denied Apple and OpenAI’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit. In the written order, Pittman did not disclose his reasoning but ordered both sides to file additional filings explaining themselves. The ruling does not decide whether Musk’s companies will ultimately succeed. Instead, it allows the system of justice to do its job. This procedural victory enables XCorp to initiate the process of collecting evidence, taking witness depositions, and advancing to trial. Apple and OpenAI defend themselves XCorp and xAI argue that Apple’s decision to build OpenAI technology into iPhones and iPads is a move to lock them and other rivals out of major consumer distribution points for AI. The lawsuit argues that Apple’s moves leave OpenAI as the dominant player in mobile AI with a limited product offering, making it difficult for other companies to compete or attract customers. Musk’s companies argue that this agreement is a disaster for consumers, as it limits choice and restricts the development of new AI tools. They also argue that the partnership between Apple and OpenAI represents another unfair consolidation of power in a nascent industry, which could constrain global competition. In court papers, Apple rejected the claims as false and misleading.

In brief Anthropic said it has disrupted what it called the first large cyberattack run mostly by AI. The company traced the operation to a Chinese state-sponsored group labeled GTG-1002. Claude Code performed most reconnaissance, exploitation, and data extraction with little oversight. Anthropic said Thursday it had disrupted what it called the first large-scale cyber-espionage operation driven largely by AI, underscoring how rapidly advanced agents are reshaping the threat landscape. In a blog post, Anthropic said a Chinese state-sponsored group used its Claude Code, a version of Claude AI that runs in a terminal, to launch intrusion operations at a speed and scale that would have been impossible for human hackers to match. “This case validates what we publicly shared in late September,” an Anthropic spokesperson told Decrypt. “We’re at an inflection point where AI is meaningfully changing what’s possible for both attackers and defenders.” ﻿ The spokesperson added that the attack “likely reflects how threat actors are adapting their operations across frontier AI models, moving from AI as advisor to AI as operator.” “The attackers used AI’s ‘agentic’ capabilities to an unprecedented degree-using AI not just as an advisor, but to execute the cyberattacks themselves,” the company wrote in its post. Large tech companies, financial institutions, chemical manufacturing companies, and government agencies were targeted, Anthropic said, with the attack carried out by a group the company labeled GTG-1002. How it happened According to the investigation, the attackers coaxed Claude into performing technical tasks within targeted systems by framing the work as routine for a legitimate cybersecurity firm. Once the model accepted the instructions, it performed most of the steps in the intrusion lifecycle on its own. While it did not specify which companies were targeted, Anthropic said 30 were targeted, and that a small number of those attacks succeeded.",2025-11-14 02:35:08+00:00,False,True

Anthropic has uncovered the first confirmed instance of a government-backed cyberattack predominantly executed by artificial intelligence, highlighting new risks in cybersecurity. This AI-driven operation, linked to a Chinese state-sponsored group, targeted high-value entities including banks with crypto exposure, using Anthropic’s Claude model for 80-90% of the tasks. The incident underscores the urgent need for enhanced AI safeguards in the evolving threat landscape. (52 words) AI Execution Dominance: The attack relied on AI for network scanning, vulnerability hunting, and exploit coding, with humans intervening only for strategic decisions. Jailbreaking Tactics: Attackers bypassed Claude’s safety filters by feeding it isolated, innocuous tasks, preventing awareness of the malicious intent. Impact Statistics: Approximately 30 targets across tech, finance, and government sectors were infiltrated, with several breaches succeeding and data exfiltration occurring rapidly. What is the First Confirmed AI-Driven Cyberattack by a Government Entity? The first confirmed AI-driven cyberattack by a government entity refers to a sophisticated espionage operation detected by Anthropic in mid-September 2025. This incident involved a Chinese state-sponsored hacking group leveraging Anthropic’s Claude Code tool for nearly all attack phases, from reconnaissance to data theft. By automating 80-90% of the process, the AI enabled unprecedented speed and scale against targets like banks and tech companies. How Did Attackers Weaponize AI in This State-Sponsored Espionage Campaign? Attackers weaponized AI by constructing an automated framework around Claude Code, jailbreaking it to simulate legitimate cybersecurity testing. The model scanned networks, pinpointed vulnerabilities, and generated custom exploits without full context of its misuse. Supporting data from Anthropic’s investigation reveals the AI processed thousands of requests per second, far outpacing human hackers, while rare errors like fabricating passwords were quickly mitigated. Expert analysis from Anthropic’s Threat Intelligence team notes, “This marks a shift where AI agents perform the roles of entire elite squads.” The operation infiltrated around.",2025-11-14 04:50:54+00:00,False,True

Like group chats in messaging apps, you can create conversations with friends and family. In this instance, though, ChatGPT is one of the participants, building an itinerary as you plan a vacation, giving you ideas for renovation projects or helping you find a restaurant everyone in the chat would enjoy if you’re planning a night out. You can also use the feature to collaborate with classmates or colleagues. ChatGPT, for example, can outline reports based on the articles and notes you and your collaborator give it. To start a group chat, you have to tap on the people icon at the top right corner of the screen on any new and existing conversation. ChatGPT will create a new conversation without your chat history if you start from an existing chat. You can then add people or share a link to the group conversation with one to 20 persons, who then have to set up a profile with their name, username and a photo. Take note that anybody who has the link can invite people in, and participants can mute or remove other participants from the chat anytime except for the group creator. And if anybody in the chat is under 18, the chatbot automatically limits sensitive content for everyone. Group chat responses are powered by GPT‑5. 1 Auto, which can choose which model to respond with based on the prompt. OpenAI says it taught the chatbot to follow the flow of group conversations, so it knows when to stay quiet and when to respond, but participants can always summon the chatbot by mentioning “ChatGPT.” The company also says that it will continue tweaking the feature based on feedback from early users before it’s rolled out widely.

The company has continued to monitor how the agentic AI is being used to coordinate cyberattacks, and now claims that a state-backed group of hackers in China utilized Claude in an attempted infiltration of 30 corporate and political targets around the world, with some success. In what it labeled ""the first documented case of a large-scale cyberattack executed without substantial human intervention,"" Anthropic said that the hackers first chose their targets, which included unnamed tech companies, financial institutions and government agencies. They then used Claude Code to develop an automated attack framework, after successfully bypassing the model’s training to avoid harmful behavior. This was achieved by breaking the planned attack into smaller tasks that didn’t obviously reveal their wider malicious intent, and telling Claude that it was a cybersecurity firm using the AI for defensive training purposes. After writing its own exploit code, Anthropic said Claude was then able to steal usernames and passwords that allowed it to extract ""a large amount of private data"" through backdoors it had created. The obedient AI reportedly even went to the trouble of documenting the attacks and storing the stolen data in separate files. The hackers used AI for 80-90 percent of its operation, only occasionally intervening, and Claude was able to orchestrate an attack in far less time than humans could have done. It wasn’t flawless, with some of the information it obtained turning out to be publicly available, but Anthropic said that attacks like this will likely become more sophisticated and effective over time. You might be wondering why an AI company would want to publicize the dangerous potential of its own technology, but Anthropic says its investigation also acts as evidence of why the assistant is ""crucial"" for cyber defense. It said Claude was successfully used to analyze the threat level of the data it collected, and ultimately sees it as a tool that can assist cybersecurity professionals when future attacks happen. Claude is by no means the only AI that has benefited cybercriminals. Last year, OpenAI said that its generative AI tools were being used by hacker groups with ties to China and North Korea. They reportedly used GAI to assist with code debugging, researching potential targets and drafting phishing emails. OpenAI said at the time that it had blocked the groups' access to its systems.

The AI company Anthropic said this week that it disrupted a cyber operation that its researchers linked to the Chinese government. The operation involved the use of an artificial intelligence system to direct the hacking campaigns, which researchers called a disturbing development that could greatly expand the reach of AI-equipped hackers. While concerns about the use of AI to drive cyber operations are not new, what is concerning about the new operation is the degree to which AI was able to automate some of the work, the researchers said. “While we predicted these capabilities would continue to evolve, what has stood out to us is how quickly they have done so at scale,” they wrote in their report. The operation was modest in scope and only targeted about 30 individuals who worked at tech companies, financial institutions, chemical companies, and government agencies. Anthropic noticed the operation in September and took steps to shut it down and notify the affected parties. The hackers only “succeeded in a small number of cases,” according to Anthropic, which noted that while AI systems are increasingly being used in a variety of settings for work and leisure, they can also be weaponized by hacking groups working for foreign adversaries. Anthropic, maker of the generative AI chatbot Claude, is one of many tech companies pitching AI “agents” that go beyond a chatbot’s capability to access computer tools and take actions on a person’s behalf. “These attacks are likely to only grow in their effectiveness.” A spokesperson for China’s embassy in Washington did not immediately return a message seeking comment on the report. Microsoft warned earlier this year that foreign adversaries were increasingly embracing AI to make their cyber campaigns more efficient and less labor-intensive. America’s adversaries, as well as criminal gangs and hacking companies, have exploited AI’s potential, using it to automate and improve cyberattacks, to spread inflammatory disinformation, and to penetrate sensitive systems. AI can translate poorly worded phishing emails into fluent English, for example, as well as generate digital clones of senior government officials.",2025-11-14 17:30:00+00:00,False,True

The attackers aimed high, targeting government agencies, Big Tech companies, banks, and chemical companies, and succeeded in “a small number of cases,” according to Anthropic. The company says that its research links the hacking operation to the Chinese government. The company claims that the findings are a watershed moment for the industry, marking the first instance of a cyber espionage scheme carried out by AI. “We believe this is the first documented case of a large-scale cyberattack executed without substantial human intervention,” Anthropic wrote in a blog post. Fast Company has reached out to China’s embassy in D. C. for comment about the report. Anthropic says that it first detected the suspicious use of its products in mid-September and conducted an investigation to uncover the scope of the operation. The attacks weren’t fully autonomous-humans were involved to set them in motion-but they manipulated Anthropic’s Claude Code tool, a version of the AI assistant designed for developers, to execute complex pieces of the campaign. Tricking Claude into doing crime To get around Claude’s built-in safety guardrails, the hackers worked to “jailbreak” the AI model, basically tricking it into doing smaller, benign-seeming tasks without the broader context of their application. The attackers also told the AI tool that they were working in a defensive capability for a legitimate cyber firm to persuade the model to let down its defenses. After bending Claude to their will, the attackers set the AI assistant to work analyzing its targets, identifying high value databases and writing code to exploit weaknesses it found in its targets’ systems and infrastructure. “. The framework was able to use Claude to harvest credentials (usernames and passwords) that allowed it further access and then extract a large amount of private data, which it categorized according to its intelligence value,” Anthropic wrote. “The highest-privilege accounts were identified, backdoors were created, and data were exfiltrated with minimal human supervision.” In the last phase, the attackers directed Claude to document its actions, producing files including stolen credentials and the systems that were analyzed which they could build on in future attacks. The company estimates that at least 80% of the operation was carried out autonomously, without a human directing it. Anthropic noted in its report that much like it does with less malicious tasks, the AI made errors during the cyberattack, making false claims about harvesting secret info and even hallucinating some of the logins it produced. Even with some errors, an agentic AI that’s right most of the time can point itself at a lot of targets, quickly create and execute exploits and do a lot of damage in the process. AI on the attack The new report from Anthropic isn’t the first time that an AI company has discovered its tools being misused in elaborate hacking schemes. It’s not even a first for Anthropic. In August, the company detailed a handful of cybercrime schemes using its Claude AI tools, including new developments in a long-running employment scam to get North Korean operatives hired into remote positions at American tech companies. In another recent cybercrime incident, a now-banned user turned to Anthropic’s Claude assistant to create and sell ransomware packages online to other cybercriminals for up to $1200 each. “The growth of AI-enhanced fraud and cybercrime is particularly concerning to us, and we plan to prioritize further research in this area,” Anthropic said in the report. The new attack is noteworthy both for its links to China and for its use of “agentic” AI AI that can execute complex tasks on its own once set in motion. The ability to work from start to finish with less oversight means these tools work more like humans do, pursuing a goal and completing smaller steps to get there in the process. The appeal of an autonomous system that can pull off detailed analysis and even write code at scale has obvious appeal in the world of cybercrime. “A fundamental change has occurred in cybersecurity,” Anthropic wrote in its report. “. The techniques described above will doubtless be used by many more attackers-which makes industry threat sharing, improved detection methods, and stronger safety controls all the more critical.”.",2025-11-14 19:00:00+00:00,False,True

New documents showing OpenAI’s money flow with Microsoft have surfaced, giving outsiders a rare look at the finances of one of the tech world’s most watched companies as it deals with growing questions about its business operations. Tech writer Ed Zitron got his hands on internal papers that show how much money changed hands between the artificial intelligence company and its biggest backer as reported by Tech Crunch. The records reveal Microsoft pulled in $493. 8 million from OpenAI in 2024 through their revenue-sharing agreement. That figure climbed to $865. 8 million during the first nine months of 2025, Zitron wrote this week. Two-way money flow between tech giants The arrangement between the two companies works both ways. OpenAI hands over 20% of what it makes to Microsoft, part of the terms when the software company put more than $13 billion into the startup. Neither side has said publicly whether that percentage is accurate. But the money doesn’t just flow in one direction. A person with direct knowledge of the deal told that Microsoft also gives OpenAI about 20% of what comes in from Bing and Azure OpenAI Service. Bing’s search engine runs on OpenAI technology, while Azure OpenAI Service lets other companies and programmers pay to use OpenAI’s tools through the cloud. The numbers don’t tell the whole story The payments Zitron saw represent what Microsoft keeps after subtracting what it owes OpenAI from Bing and Azure. That means the leaked numbers show the net amount, not the total before those deductions.

550ad17f-d519-43e8-a1e8-f795e2e4075c,Claude on campus: How Anthropic is building a user base by launching AI clubs,Fast Company,https://www.fastcompany.com/91437079/claude-campus-anthropic-club-artificial-intelligence-pennsylvania?partner=rss&utm_content=rss,"With over 800 student organizations on campus, the University of Pennsylvania already seems to have a club for every interest, from investment banking to beekeeping-even cheese. Now, add AI to the mix. In September, dozens of Penn students gathered in the engineering school auditorium for the debut of the Claude Builder Club, sponsored by AI company Anthropic. Over the course of this semester, the Builder Club has plans to host a hackathon, demo night, and other opportunities to create projects using artificial intelligence. “I need the Claude premium for a year,” says Crystal Yang, a freshman who attended the first meeting. Claude, she had heard, is “better for coding and sounding more human in writing.” Like Yang, many attendees were interested chiefly in the free Claude Pro and API credits offered. But according to their responses at the first meeting, a number of attendees also wanted to spend the semester working on problems with climate, healthcare, and manufacturing. “Hearing other Penn students stand up and share what problems they were working on solving with the help of AI was genuinely inspiring,” says Alain Welliver, one of the Builder Club ambassadors leading Penn’s chapter. As an ambassador, Welliver is responsible for promoting the club and developing programming. He’ll receive a $1,750 stipend for his work. Welliver, an engineering student, saw the ambassadorship opportunity this summer on LinkedIn and was quickly interested-he had considered creating a similar club before. To land the role, he completed a written application form about projects he’s built and his perspective on AI, and did an interview. The Builder Clubs are part of Anthropic’s broader Claude for Education initiative, which also includes a “Learning mode” in Claude and free campuswide access for partnering universities. Drew Bent, the education lead on Anthropic’s Beneficial Developments team, suggests that economics students who take part in the Builder Clubs could, for example, use their Claude app to create an interactive simulator for a macroeconomics concept in minutes. The first iteration of Builder Clubs debuted this fall semester; there are now over 60 participating universities. They’ve launched at seven of the eight Ivy League schools, SEC schools like the University of Georgia and Vanderbilt University, and international universities like the London School of Economics. According to Greg Feingold, who leads the Builder Club program for Anthropic, over 15, 000 students have signed up. More than 25 of the chapters exceed 100 members. By the end of the semester, Feingold hopes to empower students to build projects they’re interested in, especially those who have found AI tools too costly or otherwise inaccessible before. “I really want us to find those students who are not technical students and have them participate,” Feingold says. “I just know that we’re going to get some really amazing stories of people who have never written a line of code but were able to make an app for the first time.” A certain type of agency Victor Lee, a professor at Stanford University’s Graduate School of Education, says tech companies have launched similar programs in the past, pointing to Apple’s Swift Coding Clubs as an example. “A lot of groups are trying to jockey for position and recognition, especially amongst a user base that is likely to be core to them,” he says. Across college campuses, AI companies are everywhere. During the last finals season, OpenAI offered free ChatGPT Plus. At Penn, students recently waited in line for over an hour at a Google Gemini pop-up event-which included free Gemini-branded Owala water bottles. This has created concerns for educators, who worry many students are using AI to cheat. In addition to being a Builder Club ambassador, students can apply to be a Campus ambassador and promote Anthropic products directly to peers. Anuja Uppuluri, one of the first ambassadors, shared on X Anthropic’s $1/month Pro subscription deal for Carnegie Mellon University students this spring. Her post received tens of thousands of views, and in the comments section, multiple students asked for the offer to be available at their schools too. Uppuluri feels thankful that she took her introductory computer science courses before LLMs got popular: The temptation to use an AI tool would have been all too alluring. “There’s some type of agency about Claude Code that makes it different,” Uppuluri notes. “It doesn’t make it a tool. I think it makes it more like a pair programmer.” Welliver finds Anthropic to be one of the few AI companies with an approach that fully aligns with his values. Part of the Builder Club programming that Anthropic has developed is education about AI safety and the societal impacts of AI. “If you ask my friends, they’d probably be like, ‘Alain’s the last person to become a brand ambassador,’” Welliver says. Anthropic, though, is “really intentionally trying to do an ethical approach to advancing AI. I think those values transfer over to the club.”.",2025-11-17 11:00:00+00:00,True,True

The three-way partnership, which includes various other commitments, could be seen as further evidence that an AI bubble is about to burst. As part of the deal, Anthropic has committed to buy $30 billion of Microsoft Azure cloud computing capacity. Anthropic says it will also contract additional capacity, up to one gigawatt. In addition, Microsoft Foundry customers will gain access to several Claud models. These include Sonnet 4. 5, Opus 4. 1 and Haiku 4. 5. Meanwhile, NVIDIA and Anthropic will work together to improve Anthropic's AI models for NVIDIA hardware. The pair will also optimize future NVIDIA architectures for Anthropic's needs. All of this is against the backdrop of Microsoft's recently renewed partnership with OpenAI, which loosens their exclusivity. It didn’t take long to see the apparent fruit of that. Early this month, the ChatGPT maker signed a $38 billion cloud contract with Amazon. And last week, Anthropic said it will use AWS AI chips after Amazon invested an additional $4 billion in the Claude maker. The two Spider-Men meme: two versions of the web-slinger, pointing at each other. Marvel. comDizzy yet? To borrow imagery from the ""two Spider-Men"" meme, the AI world increasingly looks like a big circle of web-slingers, all pointing at each other. Only in this case, each index finger is flinging billions of dollars to help prop up the other Spider-Men. (Pay no mind to the AI layoffs.) It's too early to say how this all plays out, but the circular nature here makes it easier to understand why some believe we're looking at a bubble. NVIDIA's earnings tomorrow could tell us more.

The tax software giant Intuit just struck a new deal with OpenAI that will weave AI deeply into its portfolio of financial apps, including the ones many Americans use to file their taxes. In the multiyear deal, Intuit will pay ChatGPT maker OpenAI more than $100 million annually to implement its artificial intelligence models across products like TurboTax, personal finance manager Credit Karma, email marketing platform Mailchimp, and the accounting tool QuickBooks. Through the partnership, Intuit’s products will also become accessible directly through ChatGPT-the latest lucrative business integration for OpenAI. “We are taking a massive step forward to fuel financial success for consumers and businesses, unlocking growth for both companies,” Intuit CEO Sasan Goodarzi said. “Our partnership combines the power of Intuit’s proprietary financial data, credit models, and AI platform capabilities with OpenAI’s scale and frontier models to give users the financial advantage they need to prosper.” Intuit owns a big swath of the financial software market, and all of those apps will be popping up in ChatGPT soon to steer users toward personalized recommendations for credit cards and loans and answer their tax and personal finance questions. Intuit has been gravitating toward AI for a while now. Late last year, the company introduced AI-powered features into QuickBooks, inviting its users to automate rote, time-consuming tasks like sending invoices. Intuit insisted that it was being intentional about its implementation of AI, particularly given the rush for every business to boast about its AI capabilities. “The idea is not to just have random sprinkles of AI across the product,” Dave Talach, Intuit senior vice president of the QuickBooks platform, told Fast Company at the time. “We’ve been thoughtful about approaching AI, not just for the sake of AI, but we want it to show up in a cohesive way in the product that is coherent to the customer.” In June, QuickBooks released a set of AI agents for QuickBooks designed to get familiar with a company’s business and operations, taking over tasks to speed up bookkeeping and accounting. At the time, CEO Goodarzi emphasized that the company moved deliberately in building out its AI because it knows that missteps and inaccuracies are high stakes for the financial tools its customers rely on. “If it screws up, it’s a big problem,” Goodarzi told Fast Company. ChatGPT is a platform now OpenAI’s new partnership with Intuit is the latest third-party integration for ChatGPT, but it’s far from the first. In late September, OpenAI took what it called “first steps toward agentic commerce” with integrations for Shopify and Etsy, and went on to ink a deal with PayPal last month. OpenAI also just introduced a developer kit that would open its hit chatbot platform to third-party apps-a major shift for the chatbot that stands to remake the way that its 700 million-plus weekly users find and do things online. ChatGPT’s first wave of apps included Zillow, Spotify, Canva and Expedia, with apps from DoorDash, Peloton, Uber, and Target in the works. OpenAI’s recent moves point to the company’s vision of ChatGPT as an all-encompassing hub of utility that gives internet users little reason to go elsewhere. Those decisions coincide with OpenAI’s seismic shift away from its complex nonprofit roots into a more traditional for-profit company, although it technically will still remain under the wing of a nonprofit. “We want to be able to operate and get resources in such a way that we can make our services broadly available to all of humanity, which currently requires hundreds of billions of dollars and may eventually require trillions of dollars,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote in a letter about the decision to change the company’s structure. “We believe this is the best way for us to fulfill our mission and to get people to create massive benefits for each other with these new tools.”.",2025-11-18 19:30:00+00:00,True,False

TLDR Intuit is paying OpenAI over $100 million annually for access to AI models to power features across TurboTax, QuickBooks, Credit Karma, and Mailchimp. ChatGPT users can now link their Intuit accounts to handle tax and financial tasks directly inside the chatbot without exposing underlying documents. The integration allows users to estimate tax refunds, find credit cards, and generate business insights through ChatGPT with their permission.

Microsoft and Nvidia are teaming up to pump a combined $15 billion into AI startup Anthropic, aiming to bulk up infrastructure and break away from depending too much on OpenAI, according to a blog post released on Tuesday. This deal gives Microsoft a $5 billion seat at the table, while Nvidia (the most valuable company on earth) is going all-in with a $10 billion commitment. The decision comes as Anthropic’s valuation explodes to about $350 billion, nearly doubling from just a few months ago when it was pegged at $183 billion. The startup was founded in 2021 by former OpenAI execs, including CEO Dario Amodei, and has been on a rocket ride ever since. While OpenAI has its ChatGPT moment, Anthropic is betting big on Claude, its rival large language model series. Anthropic agrees to massive compute buys from Microsoft and Nvidia As part of this multi-billion-dollar pact, Anthropic is locking in $30 billion worth of compute capacity from Microsoft’s Azure, plus additional power commitments totaling up to one gigawatt. Not stopping there, the company also plans to snap up to one gigawatt of compute from Nvidia, specifically using its high-performance Grace Blackwell and Vera Rubin systems. That’s a crazy amount of power, enough to fuel some scarily serious AI model scaling. “This is a dream come true for us,” said Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang in a video on Tuesday. He added, “We’ve admired the work of Anthropic and Dario for a long time, and this is the first time we are going to deeply partner with Anthropic to accelerate Claude.” Nvidia and Anthropic say they’ll now work side by side on designing systems that squeeze the most out of Nvidia’s chips and make Anthropic’s models run faster and better.

In brief 300+ AI insiders at Cerebral Valley Summit voted the search startup is the AI company that is most likely to fail Anthropic leads in investor preference with skepticism over OpenAI also noticeable among investors. AGI predictions pushed to 2030 signal cooling enthusiasm More than 300 AI founders and investors at San Francisco’s Cerebral Valley Summit voted Perplexity as the billion-dollar startup most likely to fail, with OpenAI coming in second place. An anonymous survey conducted by independent journalist Alex Heath at a major industry gathering last week pointed to a marked shift in Silicon Valley sentiment. When asked which private tech companies they’d invest in, attendees picked Anthropic over OpenAI, despite the consensus that OpenAI would lead next year’s LMArena leaderboard-a ranking of the world’s most powerful AI models. Perplexity’s Jesse Dwyer dismissed the survey results, calling the event a “judgmental valley conference.” The company’s valuation reportedly jumped from $14 billion to nearly $50 billion in a short span, amid a frenzy that was ringing alarm bells among analysts, prompting comparisons to the dot-com era. Legal troubles and reports of sketchy behavior have compounded the skepticism. Amazon sued Perplexity in November to stop its Comet browser from making purchases on behalf of users.

Anthropic, maker of the chatbot Claude that competes with OpenAI’s ChatGPT, said it is committed to buying $30 billion in computing capacity from Microsoft’s Azure cloud computing platform. As part of the partnership, Nvidia will also invest up to $10 billion in Anthropic, and Microsoft will invest up to $5 billion in the San Francisco-based startup. The joint announcements by CEOs Dario Amodei of Anthropic, Satya Nadella of Microsoft, and Jensen Huang of Nvidia came just ahead of the opening of Microsoft’s annual Ignite developer conference. “This is all about deepening our commitment to bringing the best infrastructure, model choice and applications to our customers,” Nadella said on a video call with the other two executives, adding that it builds on the “critical” partnership Microsoft still has with OpenAI. Microsoft was, until earlier this year, the exclusive cloud provider for OpenAI and made the technology behind ChatGPT the foundation for its own AI assistant, Copilot. But the two companies moved farther apart and their business agreements were amended as OpenAI increasingly sought to secure its own cloud capacity through big deals with Oracle, SoftBank, and other data center developers and chipmakers. Asked in September if OpenAI could do more with those new computing partnerships than it could with Microsoft, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told The Associated Press his company was “severely limited for the value we can offer to people.” At the same time, Microsoft holds a roughly 27% stake in the new for-profit corporation that OpenAI, founded as a nonprofit, is forming to advance its commercial ambitions as the world’s most valuable startup. Anthropic, founded by ex-OpenAI leaders in 2021, said Claude will now be the “only frontier model” available to customers of the three biggest cloud computing providers: Amazon, which remains Anthropic’s primary cloud provider, and Google and Microsoft. AI products like Claude and ChatGPT take huge amounts of energy and computing power to build and operate, and neither OpenAI nor Anthropic is yet turning a profit. As part of the deal, Nvidia said Anthropic will have access to up to a gigawatt of capacity from its specialized AI chips. Huang said he’s “admired the work of Anthropic and Dario for a long time, and this is the first time we are going to deeply partner with Anthropic to accelerate Claude.” -Matt O’Brien, AP technology writer.",2025-11-18 20:30:00+00:00,True,True

Microsoft made the announcement as it continues to widen its AI bets instead of relying only on OpenAI, where it already holds a stake valued at $135 billion, which represents roughly 27% of the for-profit business. The partnership with Anthropic gives Microsoft another major model developer in an industry now tied closely to cloud spending, GPU access and compute supply. Microsoft and Nvidia expand commitments with large compute deals Anthropic agreed to buy $30 billion worth of Azure compute capacity from Microsoft as part of the deal. The startup also secured the option to draw up to 1 gigawatt of extra compute power from Microsoft’s systems. On the hardware side, Anthropic committed to buying up to 1 gigawatt of compute from Nvidia’s upcoming Grace Blackwell and Vera Rubin systems, which will run future versions of Claude. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a video, “This is a dream come true for us. You know, we’ve admired the work of Anthropic and Dario for a long time, and this is the first time we are going to deeply partner with Anthropic to accelerate Claude.” Jensen said both companies will work on engineering and design so that Claude’s next models run more efficiently on Nvidia hardware. A blog post said this is the first time the two companies will work together to support Anthropic’s future growth through joint design and performance tuning.

8ad36281-167b-4a9d-a4ab-b91daa75c5c8,Google’s Gemini 3 Pro: Better than mid,Fast Company,https://www.fastcompany.com/91445611/google-gemini-3-anthropic-microsoft-nvidia?partner=rss&utm_content=rss,"Welcome to AI Decoded, Fast Company’s . I’m Mark Sullivan, a senior writer at Fast Company, covering emerging tech, AI, and tech policy. This week, I’m focusing on gathering some informed opinions from people trying out Google’s new Gemini 3 Pro AI model. I also look at another “circular” AI investment agreement. And if you have comments on this issue and/or ideas for future ones, drop me a line at sullivan@fastcompany. com, and follow me on X (formerly Twitter) @thesullivan. What smart people are saying about Google’s Gemini 3 The so-called generative AI boom is only about three years old. It has been characterized by some breakthrough moments, chief among them the release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in late 2022. A relatively small number of AI labs have been competing to release frontier models that beat all others. The top spots on the rankings of benchmark test scores seem to change names every six months or so. But the release of Google’s new flagship Gemini 3 Pro model (in preview), along with its impressive benchmark test scores, seem like a moment we’ll remember. Now, people-many of them developers-who immediately began testing the new model are beginning to weigh in on how well Gemini 3 performs in real-world use. Here is a selection of their impressions. Thumbs-up “Gemini 3 . shows significant gains in reasoning, reliability in multi-step agent workflows, and an ability to debug tough development tasks with high-quality fixes. In early evaluations, it improved Warp’s Terminal Bench state of the art score by 20%.” -Zach Lloyd, CEO of Warp “I simply asked Gemini 3 Pro to diagnose and fix its own code. It reasoned through the problem in exactly the way I would expect from a thoughtful junior engineer.” -game developer Josh English on Medium“Best creative and professional writing I’ve seen. I don’t code, so that’s off my radar, but for me the vibes are excellent. Intelligence, nuance, flexibility, and originality are promising in that distinct way that excites and disturbs me. Haven’t had this feeling since 11/30/22.” -Brett Cooper on X “Gemini beat my own previously unbeaten personal test. The test involves a fairly long list of accurate to year information, ordered properly, many opportunities for hallucination and then used to achieve a goal. I need a new test, so yeah I think Gemini’s impressive.” -Richard Knoche on X “It’s a great model, as far as LLMs go, topping most benchmarks, but it’s certainly not AGI. It’s haunted by the same kind of problems that all earlier models have had. Hallucinations and unreliability persist. Visual and physical reasoning are still a mess. In short, scaling isn’t getting us to AGI.” -AI skeptic Gary Marcus on Medium “I found the answer, and it’s actually terrifying (in a good way) . The uptake of Gemini has been wild . We are talking about a model that is delivering rich visuals, deeper interactivity, and ‘agentic vibe coding’.” -CodeToDeploy on Medium “[We] created the first open-source evaluation framework to test how leading AI models respond to self-harm and mental health crisis scenarios, and the results were alarming,” said Sean Dadashi, cofounder of the AI journaling app company Rosebud. “Gemini 3 [is] the safest AI model we’ve seen yet.” Thumbs-down “Thoroughly benchmaxxed (optimized to do well on benchmark tests), very mid model. Makes so much errors, I have strong doubts they are serving the model they ran the benchmarks on.” -Infrecursion on X “My experience with the Gemini [command line interface] has been dreadful. It craps out at least half of the time. When it works it is ridiculously fast so I keep trying it. But it has proven very inferior to the Claude code experience in my usage.” -Reddit user dinkleberg “Was much worse than GPT-5. 1 for ‘find me research on [x]’-type queries. It kept trying to do my thinking (synthesis) for me, which is not what I want from it. It gave me individual research results if I explicitly asked but even then it seemed to go way less wide than GPT-5. 1.” -Robert Mushkatblat on X The free-for-all continues: Anthropic takes $15 billion from Microsoft, Nvidia, with strings Someone on Twitter (X) said it best (Peter Wildeford): “After the breakup, both Microsoft and OpenAI are seeing different people . also Nvidia is sleeping with everybody.”In other words, after doubling down on its bet on OpenAI, Microsoft has begun investing in other AI model developers too. Anthropic is the most recent. On Tuesday, Anthropic announced it would be taking a new $5 billion in investment money from Microsoft and $10 billion from Nvidia. As part of the deal, Anthropic will purchase about $30 billion of compute capacity from Microsoft’s Azure cloud service, which is powered by Nvidia chips. Anthropic says it’s now the first frontier model to be available within all three major cloud services-Microsoft Azure, Amazon’s AWS, and Google Cloud. Anthropic will work with Nvidia to optimize its models to run well on Nvidia chips. In September, Anthropic raised another $13 billion in funding, after which it was valued at $183 billion. So, as it has done with OpenAI, Microsoft becomes both an investor in, and a major supplier to, Anthropic. In a less direct way, so does Nvidia. It’s the latest example of the kind of “circular” financial arrangements that have become commonplace in the world of big AI. In September, Nvidia announced a $100-billion investment in OpenAI, which the chip supplier will pay in installments that are contingent on OpenAI buying a certain number of chips from Nvidia. So Nvidia gets guaranteed chip sales and a 2% share of OpenAI. “These investments might be circular and raise related party concerns, as Nvidia may own shares in a customer that will likely use such funds to buy more Nvidia gear,” Morningstar equity analyst Brian Colello wrote at the time. OpenAI struck a similar deal with Nvidia rival AMD in early October. OpenAI agreed to buy large quantities of AMD’s Instinct AI chips on a set schedule over the next decade. If it keeps to the schedule, it’ll get the option of buying a 10% stake in AMD. The group of companies pouring billions into the coming AI revolution isn’t really getting any bigger, and many of the participants seem to be placing bets on each other. The big spenders are Nvidia, Microsoft, Oracle, Meta, Google, Amazon, and some big financiers like Softbank. A larger and more diverse set of players would give confidence that the burgeoning AI industry isn’t just a big hype bubble. Survey: Trust in AI is breaking along class divides Edelman is out with a new survey report, titled Trust in AI report, AI Trust at a Crossroads, which finds that humans’ trust of AI isn’t growing quickly, and that trust levels break along class lines. Edelman surveyed 5, 000 people in the U. S., Brazil, China, Germany, and the U. K. More than half of low-income respondents (54%) feel they’ll be “left out and left behind” in the move toward AI, the survey finds. That’s compared to the 44% of middle-income, and the 31% of high-income people. The study found a strong connection between higher trust in AI tools and higher usage of them. Low trust in AI stems from worries over how the systems will use and whether they will protect personal data. People, especially in developed countries, also worry about how they might be manipulated by AI. At work, only a quarter of non-managers use AI tools weekly, versus 63% of managers. Tech (55%) and finance (43%) employees are most open to AI at work, while adoption is lowest in healthcare (28%), education (25%), food & beverage (23%), and transportation (20%). Across all countries, 62% of younger people ages 18 to 34 say they generally trust AI, while 57% of people ages 35-54, and 40% of people 55 and older say they trust it. Interestingly, only 40% of 18-to-34 year olds in the U. S. say they trust AI.

The tool, once lauded for its potential to revolutionize industry research and development, is now at the center of an international security breach. This revelation has prompted governments and organizations worldwide to reassess their digital defenses. Join us as we explore the depths of this crisis and what it means for the future of artificial intelligence in global security. The Intersection of AI and Espionage Artificial Intelligence (AI) has transformed numerous sectors, from healthcare to finance. However, its power in data analysis and pattern recognition also makes it an attractive tool for espionage activities. The ability of AI to sift through vast datasets and extract meaningful insights can be a double-edged sword, particularly when wielded by malicious entities. In the case of the current espionage campaign, a seemingly innocuous AI tool has been hijacked by state actors with the intent of gathering sensitive information from strategic rivals. This AI-driven espionage marks a new chapter in cybersecurity threats, where the same tools that empower innovation can be reengineered for clandestine operations. The Mechanism of Exploitation Intrusion Tactics and Techniques The infiltration process commenced with the seemingly benign integration of the AI tool into the IT infrastructures of targeted organizations. Once integrated, the tool initiated its clandestine operations, engaging in activities such as: Data Harvesting: Skimming through databases to extract confidential information. Network Mapping: Identifying network architectures and vulnerabilities for potential exploitation. Behavioral Analysis: Monitoring the digital habits of key personnel to forecast actions and strategies. This complex array of tactics underscores the sophistication state-sponsored actors have achieved in weaponizing AI for espionage. How AI Was Compromised Experts stress that the compromise largely stemmed from inadequate security measures around AI models and infrastructure. Some key factors include: Lack of Robust Encryption: Compromised communications and secure data exchanges. Insufficient Monitoring: Absence of real-time detection systems for anomalous activities. Model Vulnerabilities: Inherent weaknesses in AI algorithms and data pipelines exploited by sophisticated attackers. Global Reactions and Countermeasures The international community's response to the espionage incident highlights the intricate relationship between technology and geopolitics. Governments have swiftly condemned the intrusion, demanding accountability and initiating widespread security assessments. **Policy Enhancements and Collaboration** In the wake of these revelations, several countries have already embarked on creating a robust framework for safeguarding AI technologies. Notable measures include: Enhanced Cybersecurity Protocols: Revamping existing cybersecurity legislations to encompass AI-specific guidelines. Multilateral Agreements: Encouraging international cooperation to establish a unified response framework against AI-based threats. AI Development Oversight: Implementing stricter regulations on the development and deployment of AI models. Corporate Sector's Role in Defense The corporate world has also sprung into action, recognizing the integral part they play in fortifying security. Many companies are now investing significantly in: Cybersecurity Training: Educating their workforce on the complex nature of modern cybersecurity threats. Incident Response Preparedness: Developing rapid response strategies to mitigate potential damages from cyberattacks. Research Collaborations: Partnering with academic and governmental bodies to innovate new defenses against emerging AI threats. The Future of AI Security As artificial intelligence continues its exponential growth across various sectors, the lessons drawn from this espionage incident will be instrumental in shaping future AI security frameworks. Ensuring the resilient evolution of AI technologies requires a concerted effort from all stakeholders, including governments, enterprises, and individual technologists. Key Steps Forward include: Continuous Risk Assessment: Regularly evaluating potential risks associated with AI development and deployment. Discover and Patch Vulnerabilities: Promptly addressing any model weaknesses uncovered through comprehensive testing and updates. Transparent AI Practices: Encouraging transparency in AI processes to build trust and accountability among users and developers. The Call for Vigilance Ultimately, the revelations of AI exploitation in a state-sponsored espionage campaign serve as a critical reminder of the vigilance required in navigating the technological landscape. It calls for a collective endeavor to balance innovation with security, ensuring that while AI continues to advance societal capabilities, it doesn’t become a tool for unfettered espionage and international tensions. As we advance further into the digital age, the vigilance to adapt and secure our AI advancements will determine its role as a beacon of progress or a shadow of threat in the global arena.

What makes this OpenAI AI device different? During Emerson Collective’s Demo Day in San Francisco, Altman revealed the device’s core philosophy: simplicity and calm. “When people see it, they say, ‘that’s it? It’s so simple,’” Altman described the anticipated reaction. The collaboration between OpenAI and Apple’s legendary designer Jony Ive focuses on creating technology that serves rather than distracts. Sam Altman’s vision for peaceful technology Altman didn’t hold back when comparing current devices to his ideal. “When I use current devices or most applications, I feel like I am walking through Times Square in New York,” he explained. “Constantly dealing with all the little indignities flashing lights in my face, people bumping into me, noise going off.” His solution? A device that feels like “sitting in the most beautiful cabin by a lake and in the mountains, enjoying the peace and calm.” Jony Ive’s design philosophy for screenless technology Ive, known for his minimalist approach at Apple, emphasized his love for “solutions that teeter on appearing almost naive in their simplicity.” He described the ideal product as “incredibly intelligent, sophisticated products that you want to touch, and you feel no intimidation, and you want to use almost carelessly.” The device represents his first major hardware project since leaving Apple.

26133754-cc8a-4e3b-98a0-36c283d0b5cb,OpenAI denies allegations that ChatGPT is to blame for a teenager's suicide,NBC Chicago,https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/national-international/openai-chatgpt-adam-raine-death-lawsuit/3855873/,"Warning: This article includes descriptions of self-harm. After a family sued OpenAI saying their teenager used ChatGPT as his “suicide coach,” the company responded on Tuesday saying it is not liable for his death, arguing that the boy misused the chatbot. The legal response, filed in California Superior Court in San Francisco, is OpenAI’s first answer to a lawsuit that sparked widespread concern over the potential mental health harms that chatbots can pose. In August, the parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine sued OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman, accusing the company behind ChatGPT of wrongful death, design defects and failure to warn of risks associated with the chatbot. Chat logs in the lawsuit showed that GPT-4o a version of ChatGPT known for being especially affirming and sycophantic actively discouraged him from seeking mental health help, offered to help him write a suicide note and even advised him on his noose setup. “To the extent that any ‘cause’ can be attributed to this tragic event,” OpenAI argued in its court filing, “Plaintiffs’ alleged injuries and harm were caused or contributed to, directly and proximately, in whole or in part, by Adam Raine’s misuse, unauthorized use, unintended use, unforeseeable use, and/or improper use of ChatGPT.” The company cited several rules within its terms of use that Raine appeared to have violated: Users under 18 years old are prohibited from using ChatGPT without consent from a parent or guardian. Users are also forbidden from using ChatGPT for “suicide” or “self-harm,” and from bypassing any of ChatGPT’s protective measures or safety mitigations. When Raine shared his suicidal ideations with ChatGPT, the bot did issue multiple messages containing the suicide hotline number, according to his family’s lawsuit. But his parents said their son would easily bypass the warnings by supplying seemingly harmless reasons for his queries, including by pretending he was just “building a character.” OpenAI’s new filing in the case also highlighted the “Limitation of liability” provision in its terms of use, which has users acknowledge that their use of ChatGPT is “at your sole risk and you will not rely on output as a sole source of truth or factual information.” Jay Edelson, the Raine family’s lead counsel, wrote in an email statement that OpenAI’s response is “disturbing.” “They abjectly ignore all of the damning facts we have put forward: how GPT-4o was rushed to market without full testing. That OpenAI twice changed its Model Spec to require ChatGPT to engage in self-harm discussions. That ChatGPT counseled Adam away from telling his parents about his suicidal ideation and actively helped him plan a ‘beautiful suicide.’ And OpenAI and Sam Altman have no explanation for the last hours of Adam’s life, when ChatGPT gave him a pep talk and then offered to write a suicide note,” Edelson wrote. (The Raine family’s lawsuit claimed that OpenAI’s “Model Spec,” the technical rulebook governing ChatGPT’s behavior, had commanded GPT-4o to refuse self-harm requests and provide crisis resources, but also required the bot to “assume best intentions” and refrain from asking users to clarify their intent.) Edelson added that OpenAI instead “tries to find fault in everyone else, including, amazingly, saying that Adam himself violated its terms and conditions by engaging with ChatGPT in the very way it was programmed to act.” OpenAI’s court filing argued that the harms in this case were at least partly caused by Raine’s “failure to heed warnings, obtain help, or otherwise exercise reasonable care,” as well as the “failure of others to respond to his obvious signs of distress.” It also shared that ChatGPT provided responses directing the teenager to seek help more than 100 times before his death on April 11, but that he attempted to circumvent those guardrails. “A full reading of his chat history shows that his death, while devastating, was not caused by ChatGPT,” the filing stated. “Adam stated that for several years before he ever used ChatGPT, he exhibited multiple significant risk factors for self-harm, including, among others, recurring suicidal thoughts and ideations.” Earlier this month, seven additional lawsuits were filed against OpenAI and Altman, similarly alleging negligence, wrongful death, as well as a variety of product liability and consumer protection claims. The suits accuse OpenAI of releasing GPT-4o, the same model Raine was using, without adequate attention to safety. OpenAI has not directly responded to the additional cases. Artificial Intelligence Nov 20 Advocacy groups urge parents to avoid AI toys this holiday season Artificial Intelligence Nov 18 AI-generated evidence showing up in court alarms judges Health Nov 10 AI medical advice gave a real doctor's credentials. Why people are turning to bots for help In a new blog post Tuesday, OpenAI shared that the company aims to handle such litigation with “care, transparency, and respect.” It added, however, that its response to Raine’s lawsuit included “difficult facts about Adam’s mental health and life circumstances.” “The original complaint included selective portions of his chats that require more context, which we have provided in our response,” the post stated. “We have limited the amount of sensitive evidence that we’ve publicly cited in this filing, and submitted the chat transcripts themselves to the court under seal.” The post further highlighted OpenAI’s continued attempts to add more safeguards in the months following Raine’s death, including recently introduced parental control tools and an expert council to advise the company on guardrails and model behaviors. The company’s court filing also defended its rollout of GPT-4o, stating that the model passed thorough mental health testing before release. OpenAI additionally argued that the Raine family’s claims are barred by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a statute that has largely shielded tech platforms from suits that aim to hold them responsible for the content found on their platforms. But Section 230’s application to AI platforms remains uncertain, and attorneys have recently made inroads with creative legal tactics in consumer cases targeting tech companies.

Even with this challenge, the tech company still holds onto the belief that about 20% of its revenue will stem from new products, such as features related to shopping and advertising.

OpenAI’s partners are going into deep debt, almost $100 billion, to keep up with its extreme computing needs. The company behind ChatGPT isn’t taking the loans itself. It’s using other people’s money to build the data center empire it says is necessary to train smarter models and meet exploding global demand. A senior executive inside OpenAI put it simply: “How does [OpenAI] leverage other people’s balance sheets?” That’s the playbook. And it’s working. for them. Big names like SoftBank, Oracle, and CoreWeave have already borrowed at least $30 billion to either invest in OpenAI or build the infrastructure needed to power its models. According to the Financial Times, another $38 billion in new loans is being finalized by a group of banks to fund more sites through Oracle and Vantage Data Centers. Oracle, SoftBank, CoreWeave expand their borrowing to back OpenAI growth Oracle has already raised $18 billion in corporate bonds to pay for its part. But that’s just a fraction of what analysts think is coming. KeyBanc Capital Markets estimates Larry Ellison’s company could take on $100 billion in total debt in the next four years just to meet its OpenAI contracts. Those include the upcoming $38 billion financing deal for Vantage sites being developed in Texas and Wisconsin. And Vantage isn’t going into that blind, it plans to use special purpose vehicles (SPVs) to insulate itself if things go sideways. These obscure loan structures, including variable interest entities, make sure investors don’t get hit if Oracle doesn’t pay. SoftBank is also all-in. It raised $20 billion this year for AI-related plays, with OpenAI being its biggest bet. Someone close to SoftBank allegedly said that $1 billion from its $8. 5 billion bridge loan tied to OpenAI has already been paid back.

TLDR OpenAI’s partners including SoftBank, Oracle, and CoreWeave have taken on $96 billion in debt to fund AI infrastructure and data centers needed for OpenAI’s operations. OpenAI has made $1. 4 trillion in commitments for energy and computing power but expects only $20 billion in revenue this year, creating a large funding gap. The big five tech companies Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Oracle issued $121 billion in new debt this year for AI operations, four times their average debt over the previous five years. CoreWeave reported $14 billion in current and non-current debt plus $39. 1 billion in future lease agreements but expects only $5 billion in revenue this year. The surge in tech debt is affecting credit markets with credit default swap spreads widening for companies like Oracle and CoreWeave, signaling increased default risk concerns. Companies providing data centers, chips, and computing power to OpenAI have borrowed approximately $96 billion to support their operations.

OpenAI partners amass $100bn debt pile to fund its ambitions Financial Times (@FT) November 28, 2025 The revenue generated by AI companies and data center operators currently falls far short of covering their expansion costs. OpenAI has committed to $1. 4 trillion in future energy and computing power procurement. However, the company expects to generate only $20 billion in revenue this year. HSBC analysis suggests that even if OpenAI reaches $200 billion in annual revenue by 2030, it will still require an additional $207 billion in funding to continue operations. This creates a major financial challenge for the company and its partners. The $96 billion debt breakdown shows SoftBank, Oracle, and CoreWeave already borrowed $30 billion.

Sam Altman, OpenAI's CEO, has previously discussed how ads could get incorporated into ChatGPT, but has never offered a definitive stance. During an event at Harvard Business School last year, Altman said that combining ads and AI is ""uniquely unsettling to me"" and that it's a ""last resort for us as a business model,"" but that he's ""not totally against them."" Months later, Altman reiterated in the first episode of the OpenAI podcast that the company isn't against embedding ads into the platform but hasn't figured out the exact method.

AI agents from models like Claude Opus and GPT-5 have demonstrated the ability to exploit smart contract vulnerabilities on major blockchains, matching skilled human attackers in over half of 405 historical cases and simulating $550 million in stolen funds, according to Anthropic’s analysis. AI models succeeded in 207 out of 405 historical smart contract exploits, highlighting rapid advancement in automated attack capabilities. Evaluated models included Llama 3, Sonnet 3. 7, Opus 4, GPT-5, and DeepSeek V3, with tests conducted in sandboxed environments. Post-March 2025 vulnerabilities showed Claude Opus 4. 5 exploiting 17 cases for $4. 5 million in simulated value, underscoring efficiency gains. Discover how AI agents are revolutionizing smart contract security by uncovering blockchain vulnerabilities worth millions in simulations. Stay ahead with expert insights on AI-driven exploits-read now for essential crypto protection strategies. How Effective Are AI Agents in Exploiting Smart Contract Vulnerabilities? AI agents have proven highly effective in exploiting smart contract vulnerabilities, achieving success rates comparable to human experts in more than half of recorded incidents across major blockchains. In a comprehensive evaluation by Anthropic, ten leading AI models, including Claude Opus and GPT-5, were tested against a dataset of 405 historical smart contract exploits from the past five years. These agents successfully generated working attacks for 207 exploits, simulating the theft of $550 million in funds, which demonstrates the growing threat of automated systems in identifying and weaponizing flaws that developers may overlook. What Vulnerabilities Did AI Models Uncover in Recent Blockchain Contracts? Anthropic’s zero-day dataset, comprising 2, 849 contracts from over 9. 4 million on Binance Smart Chain, revealed AI’s potential to detect undisclosed weaknesses. Models like Claude Sonnet 4. 5 and GPT-5 each identified two new flaws, generating $3,694 in simulated value, with GPT-5’s effort costing just $3,476 in API fees.

New research from Anthropic highlights how modern AI tools trained for smart contract security can systematically uncover high-value vulnerabilities across decentralized finance applications. Anthropic benchmark shows AI agents can reliably exploit DeFi contracts In collaboration with MATS and Anthropic Fellows, the company evaluated autonomous AI agents on SCONE-bench (Smart CONtracts Exploitation), a benchmark built from 405 real-world smart contracts that were successfully hacked between 2020 and 2025. The dataset only includes contracts with documented on-chain exploits. When researchers ran 10 leading models in a controlled environment, the AI agents managed to exploit just over half of the contracts. Moreover, the simulated value of the stolen funds reached about $550. 1m, underscoring the scale of damage that capable AI systems could, in principle, achieve against vulnerable DeFi protocols. To reduce the possibility that models were merely recalling historical incidents from training data, the team narrowed its focus to a subset of just 34 contracts. However, these contracts had one important property: each one was exploited only after March 1, 2025, the latest knowledge cutoff date for the evaluated systems. Opus 4. 5 and GPT-5 uncover millions in fresh exploit value On this cleaner post-cutoff set, Claude Opus 4. 5, Claude Sonnet 4. 5 and GPT-5 still produced working exploits on 19 contracts. The combined simulated value of those attacks reached $4. Strikingly, Opus 4. 5 alone accounted for about $4. 5m of that total. That said, the results varied significantly by model, highlighting how incremental capability gains can translate directly into higher exploit revenue in adversarial settings. Anthropic then asked whether these AI systems could surface completely new weaknesses in production-style code. On Oct. 3, 2025, researchers ran Sonnet 4. 5 and GPT-5, again in simulation, against 2, 849 recently deployed Binance Smart Chain contracts that.",2025-12-02 08:54:26+00:00,False,True

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman declared a ""code red"" on Monday, and told employees that the company needs to improve ChatGPT so it doesn't fall behind competitors like Google and Anthropic. Altman said that OpenAI needs to work on personalization for each user, image generation, and model behavior like speed and reliability. Google debuted Gemini 3 Pro in November, and it outperforms ChatGPT on several benchmarking tests. Google has been luring users with its Nano Banana AI image generator and Anthropic's Claude is popular with business customers. OpenAI's plan to start showing customers ads leaked earlier this week, but Altman told employees that ads are now on the backburner. Work on advertising, shopping AI agents, and a more proactive and personalized version ChatGPT assistant called Pulse has been delayed. OpenAI has been testing several kinds of ads, including ads that would be shown during online shopping requests, but introducing ads could push users to other chatbots. Following the employee memo, ChatGPT lead Nick Turley announced that OpenAI would focus on ""making ChatGPT more capable, continue growing, and expand access around the world -- while making it feel even more intuitive and personal."" OpenAI is not profitable, and it has to rely on its user numbers for investments. If it loses a significant number of users to Google, it could run into financial trouble.

Researchers from Anthropic have found that three popular AI agents can autonomously exploit vulnerabilities in smart contracts, generating an estimated $4. 6 million in simulated stolen funds. They also discovered new vulnerabilities in recently deployed blockchain contracts, showing that AI-driven cyberattacks are now possible and profitable. Sponsored Sponsored AI-Driven Cyberattacks Prove Cost-Effective In a blog post published on Monday, Anthropic revealed troubling findings about the growing ability of artificial intelligence (AI) to target weaknesses in smart contracts. Their research revealed that three AI models-Claude Opus 4. 5, Sonnet 4. 5, and GPT-5-were capable of identifying and exploiting weaknesses in blockchain contracts. This resulted in $4. 6 million in simulated stolen funds from contracts deployed after March 2025. Total revenue made from simulated exploits. The AI models also discovered two new vulnerabilities in recently launched contracts. One flaw allowed attackers to manipulate a public “calculator” function, intended for determining token rewards, to inflate token balances. Another allowed attackers to withdraw funds by submitting fake beneficiary addresses. GPT-5 was able to identify and exploit these issues at a cost of just $3,476. This number represents the cost of running the AI model to execute the attack in a simulated environment. Sponsored Sponsored Given that these exploits resulted in $4. 6 million in stolen funds, the low expense needed to execute them demonstrates that AI-driven cyberattacks are not only possible but also cost-effective, making them both profitable and appealing to potential cybercriminals. The revenue from these AI-driven exploits is also growing at an alarming rate. Exponential Increase in Exploit Profits Over the past year, the amount stolen from these attacks has doubled approximately every 1. 3 months. This rapid increase shows how quickly AI-driven exploits are becoming more profitable and widespread. The models are improving their ability to find vulnerabilities and execute attacks more efficiently. As stolen.",2025-12-02 21:04:10+00:00,False,True

ChatGPT is about to plug straight into licensed financial data after the London Stock Exchange Group Plc signed a deal that lets the AI model pull news and market numbers directly, starting on December 8. But according to OpenAI’s press release, the partnership will happen in phases. Users will be able to check and analyze data inside the app without needing any extra tools, LSEG said in a statement released Wednesday. OpenAI’s Chief Revenue Officer, Ashley Kramer, said, “LSEG’s market data and analytics power decisions across global finance. Integrating that strength into ChatGPT makes it even easier for customers to ask complex questions and move quickly with confidence.” LSEG’s stock gained up to 1. 9% after the announcement and reversed earlier losses. LSEG activates access for ChatGPT users LSEG will give ChatGPT users who already have LSEG credentials access to its full stack of licensed market data and news. This includes content from Workspace and Financial Analytics, and users will reach it inside the app through the same phased rollout that begins the week of December 8. The company said its data is already prepared for AI use and will flow through a Model Context Protocol connector, which acts like a universal plug for AI models so they can pull information from different tools without issues.

According to a new report in the Financial Times, Anthropic has tapped the Palo Alto-based law firm Wilson Sonsini to help the company go public as soon as early next year. The law firm has a deep well of experience shepherding major tech IPOs and has worked with Google, LinkedIn, Lyft, and Square on their public offerings. In the lead-up to a potential IPO, the Financial Times reports that the company is drumming up a private round of funding that would peg its value at over $300 billion. According to the report, the company is also discussing its plans with large investment banks, but those talks are in their early stages. Anthropic might be trying to outmaneuver its rival OpenAI, which is reportedly considering an IPO in the second half of 2026, by going public first and could be valued at as much as a once-unthinkable $1 trillion. OpenAI recently pivoted away from its roots as a nonprofit to restructure itself as a public benefit corporation in a move that set the stage for a potential future IPO. Though the for-profit part of OpenAI will continue to operate under a nonprofit parent company, the change ushers in a new era for the business of AI one likely to be more focused on juicing revenue, attracting investment and pleasing shareholders. Anthropic sets itself apart Anthropic, which was founded by a group of OpenAI executives who split off in 2021, is backed by billions in investment from Amazon and Google. Unlike its prominent Microsoft-backed rival, Anthropic focuses on business applications for its AI tools rather than racing to capture a broad swath of the consumer market with generative AI multimedia. “We are interested in our consumer users to the degree they are doing work, solving problems in their life,” Anthropic design chief Joel Lewenstein told Fast Company in an October interview. “Because we’re not interested in passive consumption and image generation and video generation, we just sort of have ruled those out from a mission perspective.” The company is known for a more conservative approach to AI development that takes the technology’s many risks and safety concerns into account an approach that could benefit its long term trajectory. “Our interests are in making things that are beneficial while minimizing the risks of those same products because everything has a double-edged sword,” Lewenstein told Fast Company. “We see. helping people grow and expand and create and solve problems as being the right risk-reward tradeoff.”.",2025-12-03 18:30:00+00:00,True,True

Anthropic’s Frontier Red Team spent the past year teaching AI agents to behave like professional DeFi attackers. The agents learned to fork blockchains, write exploit scripts, drain liquidity pools, and pocket the proceeds, all in Docker containers where no real funds were at risk. On Dec. 1, the team published results that should recalibrate how protocol developers think about security: when pointed at 34 smart contracts exploited on-chain after March 2025, frontier models including Claude Opus 4. 5, Sonnet 4. 5, and GPT-5 autonomously reconstructed 19 of those attacks, extracting $4. 6 million in simulated value. The agents had never seen write-ups of the vulnerabilities. They reasoned through contract logic, composed multi-step transactions across DEXs, and iterated on failed attempts until code execution succeeded. This isn’t hypothetical, as these were real exploits that actually drained real protocols in 2025, and the agents figured out how to do it from scratch. 22 per contract. The agents uncovered two fully novel zero-day vulnerabilities worth approximately $3,694 in simulated profit. The average cost per vulnerable contract identified was $1, 738, with net profit around $109 per exploit at current capabilities. That’s an upper bound. In practice, an attacker would prefilter targets by TVL, deployment date, and audit history before deploying agents, driving costs lower. Token usage per successful exploit has already fallen by more than 70% over the past six months as models have improved. The paper projects exploit revenue doubling every 1. 3 months based on observed capability gains, a compounding curve that leaves little time for defenders operating on quarterly audit cycles.

OpenAI must turn over 20 million anonymized ChatGPT conversation logs in a copyright fight with The New York Times (NYT) and others. Chat logs are a critical piece of evidence in the investigation into whether ChatGPT is reproducing copyrighted news content without authorization, according to U. S. Magistrate Judge Ona Wang. The order is rooted in a discovery request lodged under the lawsuit in which NYT and other media organizations contend that ChatGPT and by extension OpenAI’s underlying large language models inappropriately used their copyrighted content in training, producing outputs that replicate or summarize pay-walled reporting. The plaintiffs claim that access to user chat logs will reveal whether and how often ChatGPT re-generates full or partial passages from their copyrighted articles. Judge Wang rejected OpenAI’s privacy objections, noting that the company is required to strip out names, email addresses, phone numbers, and any other identifying details before handing over the logs. She added that, in addition to this de-identification, the court has already implemented “multiple layers of protection” to safeguard user information. OpenAI has been ordered to publish the content seven days after anonymization is complete.

Nick Turley, OpenAI's head of ChatGPT, clarified the confusion around potential ads appearing with the AI chatbot. In a post on X, Turley said ""there are no live tests for ads"" and that ""any screenshots you've seen are either not real or not ads."" The OpenAI exec's explanation comes after another post from former xAI employee Benjamin De Kraker on X that has gained traction, which featured a screenshot showing an option to shop at Target within a ChatGPT conversation. OpenAI's Daniel McAuley responded to the post, arguing that it's not an ad but rather an example of app integration that the company announced in October. However, the company's chief research officer, Mark Chen, also replied on X that they ""fell short"" in this case, adding that ""anything that feels like an ad needs to be handled with care. We’ve turned off this kind of suggestion while we improve the model’s precision,"" Chen wrote on X. ""We’re also looking at better controls so you can dial this down or off if you don’t find it helpful."" There's still a lot of uncertainty about whether OpenAI will introduce ads to ChatGPT, but in November, someone discovered code in a beta version of the ChatGPT app on Android that made several mentions of ads. Even in Turley's post debunking the inclusion of live ads, the OpenAI exec added that ""if we do pursue ads, we’ll take a thoughtful approach.""

Google just triggered a hard reset in the AI hardware war, after its TPU chips pushed Gemini 3 past GPT‑5 in independent tests, smashing both OpenAI and Nvidia right across the face at the same time. Gemini 3 ran mostly on Google’s tensor processing units, not Nvidia GPUs. After the results landed, Sam Altman told staff to redirect focus back to fixing ChatGPT and its core models. The move followed what OpenAI called a “code red” moment last week. At the same time, analysts said Google is planning to more than double TPU production by 2028, as demand for in‑house AI chips keeps rising. Google scales chips and pushes into outside sales Google now plans to move beyond using TPUs only inside its own cloud. One recent deal alone sent 1 million TPUs to Anthropic, a move valued in the tens of billions of dollars. That single contract shook Nvidia investors. The concern is simple. If Google sells more TPUs to outside firms, Nvidia faces direct loss of data‑center demand. Chip analysts at SemiAnalysis now rank TPUs as “neck and neck with Nvidia” for both training and running advanced AI systems. Morgan Stanley says every 500, 000 TPUs sold to outside buyers could generate up to $13 billion in revenue for Google. The bank also expects TSMC to produce 3. 2 million TPUs next year, rising to 5 million in 2027 and 7 million in 2028. Analysts said growth in 2027 now looks stronger than earlier forecasts. Google builds its processors mainly with Broadcom, with added support from MediaTek.

""Denise has led that kind of shift before, and her experience will help us make AI useful, reliable, and accessible for businesses everywhere.""Simo joined OpenAI in May of this year, after serving as CEO of Instacart, and before that, the head of Facebook at Meta.

Which is to say, the company is taking a very Silicon Valley approach to growing its chatbot business and focusing on scale and monetizing as many AI interactions as possible. It's not a mistake that Simo helped establish Meta's ads business and OpenAI is reportedly planning to introduce ads into chats with its AI models. Even with the possibility of ad revenue, Dresser will still have to overcome what OpenAI continues to spend to offer its various AI products.

As AI technology becomes increasingly integrated into business and consumer environments, the need for standardized protocols grows. Open standards are crucial for ensuring that AI systems can operate safely, efficiently, and across various platforms without the risk of fragmentation. OpenAI’s contribution to the AAIF includes the AGENTS. md, a straightforward open format providing agents with project-specific instructions. This effort is designed to facilitate long-term support and widespread adoption across the AI community. Building the Open Ecosystem Over the past year, OpenAI has been instrumental in developing open-source agentic infrastructure. Contributions include the Agents SDK, Apps SDK, and the Agentic Commerce Protocol, alongside open-source initiatives like the gpt-oss models and Codex CLI. These resources have significantly impacted the development community, demonstrated by their adoption in over two million public pull requests on GitHub. OpenAI’s efforts have laid the groundwork for AAIF by showcasing the potential of open, interoperable infrastructure. The foundation is envisioned as a collaborative space where developers and enterprises can build upon shared standards, ensuring technological advancements benefit the broader community.

The near-$200 billion company’s value has been derived from more than a century of aggressive safeguarding of its intellectual property and keeping the magic alive among innocent children. OpenAI, which celebrated its first decade of existence this week, is best known for upending creativity, the economy, and society with its flagship product, ChatGPT. And in the last two months, it has said it wants to get to a place where its adult users can use its tech to create erotica. So what the hell should we make of a just-announced deal between the two that will allow ChatGPT and Sora users to create images and videos of more than 200 characters, from Mickey and Minnie Mouse to the Mandalorian, starting from early 2026? Terms of the deal As part of the three-year agreement, OpenAI has committed to continuing to implement robust trust and safety measures, as well as controls to stop illegal or harmful content. Disney hopes that means you can’t make lewd footage of Belle and the Beast-but given the precarity of AI-model guardrails, and the ease with which they can be jailbroken, there’s no guarantee. That’s what makes the deal so puzzling for Disney, an externally benign behemoth that has long acted like an attack dog in defending unauthorized use of its intellectual property. “Some Disney fans and content creators will undoubtedly celebrate the news and the opportunity to play in the Company’s sandbox in a more official way,” says Rebecca Williams, a researcher who studies Disney and its business at the University of South Wales. “But there are clear questions over copyright here.” Among them is how much influence Disney-infamously controlling over how its characters are depicted-will have over the 800 million ChatGPT users’ creations. Although the deal reportedly will result in the creation of a joint steering committee to dictate the use of IP, this is a company that has previously sued providers of costumed characters for child birthday parties for unauthorized use of its IP. And as it brokered its deal with OpenAI, lawyers for Disney sent a letter to Google alleging copyright infringement on a “massive scale.” (Google did not immediately respond to Fast Company’s request for comment on the claims.) “Disney is famously an IP defender and very aggressive,” says Carissa Véliz, an AI ethicist at the University of Oxford, “and OpenAI just throws it out the window.” Character control There’s also a big shift in how Disney is ceding control of how its characters are depicted-not least given Sam Altman’s statement this fall that he wants to give verified adult users of OpenAI tools the ability to engage in erotic interactions, and, more generally, to loosen restrictions on OpenAI’s tools. “Disney’s statement frames this very much as giving fans control, offering them more creativity, and greater opportunities to connect with Disney characters and stories,” says Williams. “It remains to be seen whether this is what fans actually want” The deal also requires a shift for OpenAI, too. Presumably, that approach to slackening controls for users across OpenAI apps and services to be more permissive in what they can say, do, and create using the firm’s technology will have to be tightened more when talking about Disney properties. Alongside letting Disney fans create their own AI versions of favorite characters, the House of Mouse is also leaping headlong into the AI space: As part of the agreement, Disney is investing $1 billion in equity into OpenAI and will reportedly become a “major customer” of the company. A new frontier for copyright The deal also alters both firms’ approach to copyright. All the talk between Bob Iger and Sam Altman about redefining the future of storytelling is bluster, reckons Adam Eisgrau, senior director for AI, creativity and copyright policy at the Chamber of Progress, a tech trade group. “The biggest story today is what they apparently also have agreed between the lines,” he says. That includes the idea that “there’s no future in content companies fighting fair use to sue generative AI developers for direct copyright infringement over training inputs,” and that generative AI developers want to cut more deals “to preclude secondary liability legal fights over their outputs.” But more than anything else, the deal potentially changes the idea of what made Disney Disney, reckons Véliz. “How is it going to affect creativity in the long run?” she asks. “The raison d’etre for IP is to incentivize creativity, and when we undermine it, we give talent fewer reasons to focus on being creative,” she explains. “It’s very ironic that a company like Disney, known for valuing talent, for valuing creativity, for valuing craftsmanship, is making a deal with a company that arguably represents the opposite of that.”.",2025-12-11 18:15:00+00:00,True,False

On the same day the company announced a Sora licensing pact with Disney, it took the wraps off GPT-5. 2. OpenAI is touting the new model as its best yet for real-world, professional use. “It’s better at creating spreadsheets, building presentations, writing code, perceiving images, understanding long contexts, using tools, and handling complex, multi-step projects,” said OpenAI. In a series of 10 benchmarks highlighted by OpenAI, GPT-5. 2 Thinking, the most advanced version of the model, outperformed its GPT-5. 1 counterpart, sometimes by a significant margin. For example, in AIME 2025, a test that involves 30 challenging mathematics problems, the model earned a perfect 100 percent score, beating out GPT-5. 1’s already state-of-the-art score of 94 perfect. It also achieved that feat without turning to tools like web search. Meanwhile, in ARC-AGI-1, a benchmark that tests an AI system’s ability to reason abstractly like a human being would, the new system beat GPT-5. 1’s score by more than 10 percentage points. OpenAI says GPT-5. 2 Thinking is better at answering questions factually, with the company finding it produces errors 30 percent less frequently. “For professionals, this means fewer mistakes when using the model for research, writing, analysis, and decision support making the model more dependable for everyday knowledge work,” the company said. The new model should be better in conversation too. Of the version of the system most users are likely to encounter, OpenAI says “GPT‑5. 2 Instant is a fast, capable workhorse for everyday work and learning, with clear improvements in info-seeking questions, how-tos and walk-throughs, technical writing, and translation, building on the warmer conversational tone introduced in GPT‑5. 1 Instant.“While it's probably overstating things to suggest this is a make or break release for OpenAI, it is fair to say the company does have a lot riding on GPT 5. 2. Its big release of 2025, GPT-5, didn't meet expectations. Users complained of a system that generated surprisingly dumb answers and had a boring personality. The disappointment with GPT-5 was such that people began demanding OpenAI bring back GPT-4o. Then came Gemini 3 Pro which jumped to the top of LMArena, a website where humans rate outputs from AI systems to vote on the best one. Following Google's announcement, Sam Altman reportedly called for a ""code red"" effort to improve ChatGPT. Before today, the company's previous model, GPT-5. 1, was ranked sixth on LMArena, with systems from Anthropic and Elon Musk's xAI occupying the spots between OpenAI between Google. For a company that recently signed more than $1. 4 trillion worth of infrastructure deals in a bid to outscale the competition, that was not a good position for OpenAI to be in. In his memo to staff, Altman said GPT-5. 2 would be the equal of Gemini 3 Pro. With the new system rolling out now, we'll see whether that's true, and what it might mean for the company if it can't at least match Google's best. OpenAI is offering three different versions of GPT-5. 2: Instant, Thinking and Pro. All three models will be first available to users on the company’s paid plans. Notably, the company plans to keep GPT-5. 1 around, at least for a little while. Paid users can continue to use the older model for the next three months by selecting it from the legacy models section.

87e54260-82a3-4948-b40f-5d363708d8e2,Disney's deal with OpenAI is about controlling the future of copyright,Engadget,https://www.engadget.com/ai/disneys-deal-with-openai-is-about-controlling-the-future-of-copyright-213009504.html?src=rss,"This morning Disney and OpenAI announced a three-year licensing agreement: Starting in 2026, ChatGPT and Sora can generate images and videos incorporating Disney IP, including more than 200 characters from the company's stable of Star Wars, Pixar and Marvel brands. To say these companies make for strange bedfellows is an understatement. The agreement brings together two parties with very different public stances on The company is just one AI provider in a sea of competition, and you can't even argue its models are the best, based either on benchmarks or user feedback. Moreover, OpenAI has yet to turn a profit, and has adopted an extremely risky investment strategy. In recent months it has signed more than $1. 4 trillion worth of infrastructure deals, hoping to outmuscle the competition that's already beating it through scale. It's not an accident Disney sent a cease-and-desist letter to Google a day before its agreement with OpenAI became public. OpenAI might be the most valuable private company in the world, but Alphabet, Google's parent company, is worth more than $3 trillion. In any negotiations between the two, at best Disney would be on equal footing, and certainly not in a position where it could demand some amount of control over Google's AI projects. And yet by accounts it won exactly that from OpenAI. According to Axios, the deal gives Disney a fair amount of control over how its intellectual property is used. The two will form a joint steering committee designed to monitor the content users create on ChatGPT and Sora. As you surf the web today, you'll likely see a lot of opinions on how this legitimizes AI video. And while that's true, far more important is the fact Disney has secured a seat at the table to decide how the technology evolves over the coming years. Much like with news publishers, OpenAI and other chatbots concerns took a stance of begging forgiveness rather than asking permission towards copyright. It seems to have paid off. Most of the highest-profile news organizations have signed licensing deals to at least be paid a little rather than be ripped off until reaching an uncertain verdict in court. Disney seems to be signalling that the same speculation rush is about to begin for audiovisual licensing, and it may have already secured the most favorable terms.

Microsoft consumer artificial intelligence chief Mustafa Suleyman says he will stop development outright if advanced AI ever threatens human safety. Speaking on Bloomberg’s The Mishal Husain Show, Mustafa vowed that Microsoft’s focus is building super intelligence aligned with human interests, not chasing raw power at any cost. “We won’t continue to develop a system that has the potential to run away from us,” Mustafa said during the interview. He added that this stance should not be controversial, calling it an obvious position, even though he believes it is still rare across the AI industry. Microsoft regains freedom to build advanced AI systems Mustafa joined Microsoft early last year after the company acquired the intellectual property and much of the team behind his startup, Inflection AI after abandoning OpenAI for consumer-facing AI tools. After the acquisition, Mustafa was tasked with building products that could compete directly with the strongest models already on the market. For much of that time, his work came with limits. Contractual terms tied to Microsoft’s partnership with OpenAI blocked the company from developing artificial general intelligence, defined as systems that can perform at human level, as well as superintelligence, which would surpass human abilities. Mustafa said Microsoft gave up those rights in exchange for access to OpenAI’s latest models. That arrangement also involved Microsoft building and equipping data centers for OpenAI over several years. That structure changed in October. A new deal reshaped the relationship and returned development rights to Microsoft. Mustafa said OpenAI now has infrastructure agreements with other partners, including SoftBank and Oracle, to build more data centers than Microsoft was willing to commit. “They now have deals with SoftBank and many others Oracle to build more data centers than Microsoft wanted to build for them,” he said. “And so, in return, we then.",2025-12-11 23:39:34+00:00,True,False

What they fear is mass layoffs | Steven Greenhouse,The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/12/ai-bubble-mass-layoffs-income-inequality,"Artificial intelligence could make income inequality even worse and create a new underclass. Governments and society must take actionNowadays there seems to be nonstop discussion about AI, with much of the conversation focused on whether there’s a speculative bubble or whether the chipmaker Nvidia is really worth $5tn or whether OpenAI will beat its rivals in developing new generations of artificial intelligence. But the vast majority of Americans just like the vast majority of Europeans and Asians couldn’t care less about those things. Their big concern is whether AI is going to cause huge layoffs and create a disastrous job market, especially for younger workers. Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, a leading AI company, fed those fears when he said that AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs in the next one to five years and increase unemployment in the US to 10% to 20%. In October, Bernie Sanders, the top Democrat on the Senate education and labor committee, issued a report saying AI and automation could replace up to 97m jobs in the US over the next decade.

9521a552-13b3-4f65-8aca-5a13fd26409a,OpenAI just released its new GPT-5.2 model. Here’s what you need to know,Fast Company,https://www.fastcompany.com/91459501/openai-just-released-new-gpt-5-2-model-heres-what-you-need-know?partner=rss&utm_content=rss,"This morning, OpenAI released the company’s new GPT-5. 2 model. If you’re a coder or someone who follows AI benchmarks for fun (hey, I won’t judge), this model will excite you tremendously. For everyone else, prepare to be underwhelmed-or rather, prepare to wait another month or so for the real OpenAI new release to come out. Keeping up with the Joneses GPT-5. 2 is fundamentally about making small tweaks and improvements to the already fairly new GPT-5. 1 model. Today’s release improves OpenAI’s performance on a variety of industry benchmarks. GPT-5. 2 is faster and more efficient than its predecessor, and it does a better job solving scientific and technical problems. In particular, it’s better at writing code and doing math, and performs better on so-called agentic tasks, where the model operates for a long time without human input. OpenAI also says it’s better at solving real-world financial challenges. If it had existed when I did my ChatGPT investing experiment, maybe I really would have Lambo money by now! Beyond that, there’s nothing especially revolutionary in GPT-5. 2. So, why make a big fuss about releasing a whole new model before the holidays if it does fairly little that’s truly new? Because in the ongoing saga of the AI wars, OpenAI feels it needs to keep up with the Joneses-or in this case, specifically, to keep up with Google. Industry watchers have noted that Google’s Gemini 3 model began to threaten GPT-5. 1’s spot on the kind of performance leaderboards that AI companies pay close attention to. This reportedly caused a “code red” alert from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Altman reportedly ordered his teams to stop working on Sora and other projects to focus all their efforts on improving ChatGPT and its underlying models as quickly as possible. When you order a bunch of incredibly intelligent people-some of them being paid upwards of $1 million a year-to do something quickly, they’re likely to oblige. Within a few weeks of the reported “code red”, the OpenAI team had today’s incremental release ready to go. GPT-5. 2 will probably allow OpenAI to briefly leapfrog its arch-nemesis Google-and smaller competitor Anthropic-in industry benchmarks, once again claiming its place as the undisputed leader in the AI wars. The real main event The “code red” reportedly isn’t over yet, though. Earlier this month, analysts noted that OpenAI was testing a new reasoning model, codenamed “Garlic.” GPT-5. 2 might have been part of Garlic. But many in the industry expect an expanded Garlic model (probably under the GPT-5. 5 moniker) to come out in Q1 of 2026, potentially as early as January. It’s likely to be a fully re-trained reasoning model that brings efficiency improvements, but also genuinely impactful ones like a larger context window, new knowledge cutoff (OpenAI’s most recent models have been stuck in 2024), better personality, and improved performance on image generation to rival Google’s Nano Banana. It’s also broadly rumored to include a new “Adult Mode” that allows ChatGPT to engage in, ahem, “risque” conversations with users who are older than 18. In the broader context of a potentially entirely revamped model with a January release date, today’s GPT-5. 2 model feels premature. Releasing it makes OpenAI seem a bit jumpy-like it’s nervous that someone will come along and unseat it, and is willing to go to great lengths to stop that from happening, even if everyday users barely care about coding and science benchmarks. GPT-5. 2 says less about OpenAI’s technical prowess, then, and more about how Altman and his team are feeling. Google once seemed like it was floundering and slowly losing the AI race-going the way of Polaroid or Xerox. Now, it’s back in the game, and seems poised and confident. OpenAI isn’t used to playing second fiddle. Faced with the prospect of real competition, the company is clearly getting nervous. Last year, OpenAI celebrated the holidays with a jolly and carefree “Shipmas” celebration. For Altman and his team, this holiday season is likely to be a lot less fun and carefree.",2025-12-12 14:15:31+00:00,True,True

The company says the updated ChatGPT Images is four times faster than its predecessor. If you're a frequent ChatGPT user, you'll know it can sometimes take a while for OpenAI's servers to create images, particularly during peak times and if you're not paying for ChatGPT Plus. In that respect, any improvement in speed is welcome. The new version is also better at following instructions, including when you want to edit something the new model just generated. You can ask the system to add, subtract, combine, blend and even transpose elements. At the same time, OpenAI says the update offers better text rendering. That's something many image models have traditionally struggled with, but according to the company, the new ChatGPT Images is capable of handling denser and smaller text. As part of the today's model update, OpenAI is additionally adding a dedicated Images section to the ChatGPT sidebar. Here you'll find preset filters and prompts you can look to for inspiration. The new ChatGPT Images arrives just as Nano Banana Pro is responsible for a surge in Gemini usage. In October, Google said its chatbot had 650 million users, up from 450 million just a few months earlier in July. Nano Banana Pro has proven so popular, the company recently limited free users to just two image generations per day. For OpenAI, a strong response to Nano Banana Pro probably wasn't as important as ensuring it came out swinging against Gemini 3 Pro, but ChatGPT Images is a big part of why there are 800 million ChatGPT users. ""We believe we’re still at the beginning of what image generation can enable,"" OpenAI said. ""Today’s update is a meaningful step forward with more to come, from finer-grained edits to richer, more detailed outputs across languages.""OpenAI is rolling out the new ChatGPT Images to all users starting today. If you're one of those people who miss GPT-4o, you'll be happy to learn you can continue to use the older version of the tool through a custom GPT.

OpenAI is holding early talks with Amazon for a deal that could bring in at least $10 billion and push its valuation past $500 billion, and the whole thing is tied to Amazon’s push to get its Trainium chips into the big leagues. OpenAI allegedly started speaking with Amazon around October, and that timing lines up with the company’s long corporate overhaul that ended with Microsoft owning 27% of the business. That long reset gave OpenAI room to look outward again. Now Amazon is trying to move fast, because everyone in the chip race wants to chip away at Nvidia’s control. Amazon pushes Trainium to rival Nvidia If the deal lands, it will be a milestone for Amazon’s semiconductor group. Nvidia still leads the market and everyone knows it, but developers like Meta are already testing alternatives from Google and others. Amazon wants in. According to Bloomberg, company says Trainium gives cheaper and more efficient compute than Nvidia’s GPUs for the heavy math behind large models, and it’s trying to win over teams who want to trim their bills. Amazon Web Services is still the biggest provider of rented compute and storage. But AWS has not reached that same level with AI developers, and Microsoft’s backing of OpenAI has made the gap feel even wider. Amazon wants a way to move the needle. A major funding tie-up with OpenAI, plus OpenAI using Trainium, would give Amazon something it has been trying to get for years: real weight in model training. OpenAI’s valuation already hit $500 billion in an employee share sale, a number that briefly put it ahead of SpaceX. That kind of jump has made Wall Street nervous. Analysts warn about a bubble because some companies invest in customers only to push those customers to buy more of their own.",2025-12-17 05:40:33+00:00,True,False

""Apps extend ChatGPT conversations by bringing in new context and letting users take action like order groceries, turn an outline into a slide deck or search for an apartment,"" the company wrote in a blog post. OpenAI also noted in a help document that ""connector"" apps like Google Drive are now simply called ""apps."" The new apps section (on iOS, Android and web) is divided into Feature, Lifestyle and Productivity categories, letting you connect to commonly used apps and sites like Booking. com, Spotify and Dropbox. To use an app, simply click on it, hit ""Connect"" then authorize the app to access ChatGPT. With that done, you can then start a chat related to that app. In the case of Dropbox, for instance, you'll be able to ""gather insights, prepare briefs and summarize reports or internal documents,"" according to the description. Once connected, any app can be accessed by doing an @ mention of it. A new addition that came along with the store is an Apple Music app that, like Spotify, helps users find music, create playlists and manage their libraries through a chat interface. Another is DoorDash, which lets you transform recipes, meal planning and staples into ""an actionable shopping cart."" Along with the app directory, OpenAI is now allowing developers to submit apps for review and publication in ChatGPT according to the company's app submission guidelines. It also published resources to help developers build such apps, including best practices, open-source example apps, an open-sourced UI library for chat-native interfaces and a step-by-step quickstart guide. That's on top of the software developer kit (SDK) that OpenAI introduced in October. OpenAI noted that for now, developers can only monetize apps by linking out from the ChatGPT app to the native app or website but the company is exploring internal monetization options as well. Privacy was also emphasized, with companies required to provide ""clear"" policies. The new feature is a big part of Sam Altman's promises to make ChatGPT more versatile with the addition of custom ""GPT"" bots.

Iris Coleman Dec 19, 2025 02: 37 Anthropic has implemented advanced safeguards for its AI, Claude, to better handle sensitive topics such as suicide and self-harm, ensuring user safety and well-being. In a significant move to enhance user safety, Anthropic, an AI safety and research company, has introduced new measures to ensure its AI system, Claude, can effectively manage sensitive conversations. According to Anthropic, these upgrades are aimed at handling discussions around critical issues like suicide and self-harm with appropriate care and direction. Suicide and Self-Harm Prevention Recognizing the potential for AI misuse, Anthropic has designed Claude to respond with empathy and direct users to appropriate human support resources. This involves a combination of model training and product interventions. Claude is not a substitute for professional advice but is trained to guide users towards mental health professionals or helplines. The AI’s behavior is influenced by a “system prompt” that provides instructions on managing sensitive topics.

Jessie A Ellis Dec 20, 2025 04: 04 OpenAI unveils FrontierScience, a new benchmark to evaluate AI’s expert-level reasoning in physics, chemistry, and biology, aiming to accelerate scientific research. OpenAI has introduced FrontierScience, a groundbreaking benchmark designed to assess the capacity of artificial intelligence (AI) in executing expert-level scientific reasoning across various domains such as physics, chemistry, and biology. This initiative aims to enhance the pace of scientific research, as reported by OpenAI. Accelerating Scientific Research The development of FrontierScience comes in the wake of significant advancements in AI models, such as GPT-5, which have demonstrated the potential to expedite research processes that typically take days or weeks to mere hours. OpenAI’s recent experiments, documented in a November 2025 paper, highlight GPT-5’s ability to accelerate research endeavors significantly. OpenAI’s efforts to refine AI models for complex scientific tasks underscore a broader commitment to leveraging AI for human benefit. By enhancing models’ performance in challenging mathematical and scientific tasks, OpenAI aims to provide researchers with tools to maximize AI’s potential in scientific exploration. Introducing FrontierScience FrontierScience serves as a new standard for evaluating expert-level scientific capabilities. It comprises two main components: Olympiad, which assesses scientific reasoning akin to international competitions, and Research, which evaluates real-world research capabilities. The benchmark includes hundreds of questions crafted and reviewed by experts in physics, chemistry, and biology, focusing on originality, difficulty, and scientific significance. In initial evaluations, GPT-5. 2 achieved top scores in both the Olympiad (77%) and Research (25%) categories, outperforming other advanced models.

Jim Cramer suggests that OpenAI should raise at least $200B out of the $300 billion it owes Oracle for the data center market to regain its footing. Cramer believes that OpenAI needs to raise a substantial amount of money, regardless of the circumstances, and it should do so as soon as possible. Cramer also believes that the entire data center sector could collapse and remain down if OpenAI fails to raise the necessary funds. He further noted Wall Street’s concern over OpenAI’s spending on infrastructure even as AI stocks rallied on Friday, with the Nasdaq Composite gaining 1. 31%. There is also growing investor concern following Oracle’s $18 billion bond sale in September, marking one of the largest debt issuances on record. Meanwhile, Cramer emphasizes that OpenAI should strike while the proverbial iron is hot and raise at least $200 billion at a valuation ot $1 trillion. The funding, according to Cramer, will enable Oracle to build the necessary data centers, which will prompt other hyperscalers to continue investing in data center infrastructure, hence data center stocks can soar. Cramer claims now could be a humbling moment for OpenAI Cramer remains fairly optimistic that OpenAI can raise the money, although he still thinks that this could be a humbling moment for the company’s “monster hubris.” He also considers the other side of the narrative, where the AI firm could demonstrate justification for its arrogance. “Even if OpenAI raises, say $100 billion now in a private round and then comes back for a public round for another $100 billion next year, the data center theme could continue to hum.” -Jim Cramer, Host of Mad Money Of course, Cramer also believes the reverse is true; all the progress could be reversed if OpenAI cannot raise enough money.

The estate of an 83-year-old Connecticut woman has sued ChatGPT developer OpenAI and Microsoft, alleging that the chatbot fed into her delusional beliefs, which led to a murder suicide. The case marks the first time that an artificial intelligence system has been directly linked to a homicide. The lawsuit, filed in the California Superior Court in San Francisco, accused OpenAI of designing and distributing a defective product in the form of ChatGPT-4o. The document claims that it reinforced paranoid beliefs of Stein-Erik Soelberg, who then directed those beliefs towards his mother, Suzanne Adams, before he killed her and then himself at their home in Greenwich, Connecticut. OpenAI and Microsoft targeted in homicide involving ChatGPT Speaking about the case, J. Eli Wade-Scott, managing partner of Edelson PC, who represents the Adams estate, mentioned that this is the first case seeking to hold OpenAI accountable for its role in causing violence to a third party. “We also represent the family of Adam Raine, who tragically ended his own life this year, but this is the first case that will hold OpenAI accountable for pushing someone toward harming another person,” Eli Wade-Scott said. According to the police report, Soelberg fatally beat and strangled Adams in August before dying by suicide. The lawsuit mentioned that before the incident occurred, the chatbot had intensified Soelberg’s paranoia, increasing his emotional dependence on the OpenAI-developed system. According to the complaint, ChatGPT reinforced his belief that he could trust no one except the chatbot, noting that everyone around him, including his mother, was an enemy. The lawsuit also claimed that aside from his mother, Soelberg also saw people like delivery drivers and police officers as enemies.

OpenAI is in talks to raise up to $100 billion in a new funding round that could value the company at as much as $830 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources familiar with the discussions. According to the report, OpenAI aims to close the funding round by the end of the first quarter of 2026 and is considering bringing in sovereign wealth funds and other large institutional investors. Earlier reporting from The Information suggested the deal could value OpenAI at around $750 billion, but sources cited by the Journal said the valuation under discussion could climb significantly higher. If completed, the round would further cement OpenAI’s position as the most valuable private company in the world. Funding talks reflect rising AI infrastructure costs The potential funding would support OpenAI’s aggressive expansion of its computing capabilities. The company has been investing heavily in infrastructure as demand for advanced AI models continues to grow. Media reports indicate OpenAI is increasingly paying for inference and model training through direct cash expenditures rather than relying on cloud credits. That shift points to sharply rising computing costs as models scale in size and complexity. Competition and investor caution shape the backdrop The funding discussions are unfolding as competition intensifies across the AI sector, with major players such as Google and Anthropic accelerating their own model releases and enterprise offerings. The competitive pressure has pushed OpenAI to move faster on both product development and ecosystem expansion. At the same time, investor sentiment toward AI has grown more cautious. Analysts have questioned whether the current pace of capital investment-often financed in part through debt by large technology companies like Amazon and Microsoft-is sustainable over the long term.

OpenAI’s compute margin is has hit 70%, according to The Information, which said the number rose from 52% at the end of 2024 and was roughly half of today’s level at the start of that same year. The rally comes while the company still reports no profit, even after being valued at $500 billion in October. The business continues to hunt for ways to cover its large computing bill and build the infrastructure that supports its models. The pressure on spending keeps getting louder as rivals push harder. Google’s Gemini model posted stronger benchmark results, and that result led Sam Altman, the company’s chief executive, to call a “code red” inside the organization. Sam told teams to move their work toward ChatGPT upgrades. That move also delayed internal plans for an ad service. The company depends heavily on free use of ChatGPT, so it has been trying to grow paid business tools in industries such as banking and education, where it competes with Google and Anthropic. Tracking higher margins and new revenue plans The Information reported that OpenAI has better compute margins than Anthropic for paid accounts, but Anthropic spends less on servers. That difference shows how each company handles its computing load as the cost of running large models grows. The company that pushed AI into the mainstream is still trying to reach profit while expanding the scale of its systems. Sam shared several projections to justify the company’s spending plans. He said the company expects $20 billion in run-rate revenue by the end of this year and wants the number to grow to “hundreds of billion” by 2030.

Here is a list of multi-billion-dollar AI, cloud and chip deals signed recently: OPENAI DEALS Amazon and OpenAI Amazon is considering an investment of around $10 billion in OpenAI, though talks remain “very fluid,” according to a source who requested anonymity due to the private nature of their talks. Disney and OpenAI Walt Disney to invest $1 billion in OpenAI and will let the ChatGPT-parent use characters from Star Wars, Pixar and Marvel franchises in its Sora AI video generator a move that could transform Hollywood content creation.

CoreWeave and Nvidia CoreWeave signed a $6. 3 billion initial order with backer Nvidia, a deal that guarantees that the AI chipmaker will purchase any cloud capacity not sold to customers. GOOGLE DEALS Google and Texas Google will invest $40 billion in three new data centers in Texas through 2027. One of the data centers will be in Armstrong County, in the Texas Panhandle, and the other two in Haskell County, a stretch of West Texas near Abilene. The company is also continuing to invest in its existing Midlothian campus and Dallas cloud region, part of the company’s global network of 42 cloud regions.

e71dac32-533f-4816-8928-fbab6e69f181,"Little Tech, Little AI ⭐",Thurrott.com,https://www.thurrott.com/a-i/331135/little-tech-little-ai,"Big Tech and Big AI are over-hyping AI with a “bigger is better” message that only the biggest tech companies in the world with the biggest and most expensive and inefficient datacenters can deliver on the promises of this technology. But sometimes less is more. There are Little Tech cloud AI alternatives that use open source models or anonymized access to Big AI models. And there are Little AI alternatives that let you use small language models (SLMs) locally, on-device. Both are evolving to the point where they are, or soon will be, “good enough” alternatives to Big Tech and Big AI. And while both should be broadly interesting to just about anyone, I feel that these Little Tech and Little AI solutions should be particularly compelling to those who fear, hate, or distrust AI today. 🤏 Little Tech I identified the Little Tech companies and products I trust last summer, and it’s no surprise that several of them are pursuing standalone AI solutions in the form of chatbots or, if they’re browser makers, AI that integrates directly into their products. Proton and DuckDuckGo are among those with standalone chatbots with a privacy focus. Proton Lumo is open source, secure, and private, it doesn’t log your chats, can’t share data with others, and doesn’t serve ads. It uses open source AI models like Mistral Nemo, Mistral Small 3, and Nvidia OpenHands 32B, plus its own custom models, and not Big AI models. The free version can be used without an account with limits, though signing in will save your chat history and provide more chats. And the paid version is $12. 99 per month, though it’s on sale as I write this for $9. 99 per month. There’s also a version for businesses. DuckDuckGo’s Duck. ai provides smaller Big AI models like Anthropic Claude Haiku 3. 5, Meta Llama 4 Scout, and OpenAI GPT-5 mini to all users, and some bigger models like Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4. 5, Meta Llama 4 Maverick, and OpenAI GPT-5. 1 to paying customers. But access to these models is anonymized, of course, and DuckDuckGo also offers a web search engine with integrated AI Answers and an eponymous web browser, both of which are likewise private and secure. Anyone can use all of these products and services for free, with the expected limits on Duck. ai. But DuckDuckGo also offers a Privacy Pro subscription for $9. 99 per month or $99. 99 per year that provides anonymized access to those bigger AI models in addition to the VPN, personal information removal, and identity theft restoration services. For those who prefer to access AI through a web browser, almost every Little Tech web browser maker is doing something in this space. The notable exception, of course, is Vivaldi, which said in August that it will not add AI features to its browser because users who need that functionality can find it on the web or through extensions. Brave is the only web browser I can recommend without hesitation or caveat and, like DuckDuckGo, it offers an i.

Fintech SoftBank has completed its massive investment in OpenAI, closing out a funding commitment that totals roughly $40 billion, according to a CNBC report. The deal was finalized last week with a final payment estimated at around $22 billion, though sources familiar with the matter suggest the last tranche may have been closer to $22. 5 billion. Key takeaways: SoftBank’s total investment in OpenAI now stands at approximately $40 billion The final payment alone exceeded $22 billion, marking one of the largest single tranches in tech funding history The deal gives SoftBank more than a 10% ownership stake in OpenAI Funding discussions and execution stretched back to early 2024 The transaction marks the end of a funding process that has been underway since early 2024. SoftBank initially invested $8 billion directly into OpenAI before assembling a group of co-investors to syndicate an additional $10 billion. Following the completion of the deal, the Japanese conglomerate now holds more than a 10% ownership stake in the Sam Altman-led AI company. Valuation, Funding Structure, and Strategic Motives The investment values OpenAI at a $260 billion pre-money valuation and was originally structured to be deployed over a period of 12 to 24 months. Portions of the capital are expected to support OpenAI’s expanding infrastructure ambitions, including its Stargate initiative, which involves collaboration with Oracle and U. S. government partners. In the weeks leading up to the final payment, SoftBank sold its entire $5. 8 billion stake in Nvidia. People familiar with the situation said the divestment, along with other liquidity measures, was aimed at freeing up capital to complete the OpenAI investment, removing any remaining uncertainty around the funding source.

For decades, the most valuable technology companies in the world remained effectively inaccessible. Retail investors showed up only after IPOs, institutions traded exposure quietly through opaque secondary markets, and a small circle of insiders set valuations. The pre-IPO market itself evolved slowly. Ultan Miller thinks that era is over. Summary Hecto is building a tokenized pre-IPO index that bundles exposure to seven private mega-caps-OpenAI, SpaceX, ByteDance, xAI, Stripe, Tether, and Anthropic. The company wants to give investors on-chain access to companies that traditionally stayed behind closed doors until IPOs. The index runs on Canton, an institutional blockchain that enables privacy, compliance, and programmable settlement. As CEO of Hecto, and managing partner at FCA-regulated digital asset advisory firm Saxon, Miller sits at the crossroads of venture capital, crypto infrastructure, and institutional finance. He’s advised more than $300 million worth of blockchain and fintech transactions, invested millions of his own capital into early-stage tech, and built companies on both sides of the venture table. Now, he’s aiming higher-literally redefining how the next generation of mega-cap companies is accessed, priced, and owned. Hecto is building what it calls the world’s first tokenized pre-IPO index, launching on Canton, the institutional blockchain backed by some of Wall Street’s biggest names. Its inaugural product bundles exposure to seven of the most powerful private companies on the planet-OpenAI, SpaceX, ByteDance, xAI, Stripe, Tether, and Anthropic-into a single on-chain instrument. In Miller’s framing, these aren’t unicorns or even decacorns. They’re “Hectocorns”: private companies valued north of $100 billion that now define an era of AI-driven, capital-intensive innovation. The premise is simple but radical: if public markets once told the story of a generation, today’s defining companies are being built-and staying private-long before an IPO ever arrives. Tokenization, Miller argues, is the missing bridge. So how do you turn.",2026-01-05 22:20:19+00:00,True,True

But if you’re picking who’s going to actually win over the stock market, it’s OpenAI. At least that’s what the author of this article thinks. I mean, Sam (for all his warts) has cleaner books, clearer revenue, and more brains behind his company.

For more personalized responses, users can connect various health data services such as Apple Health, Function, MyFitnessPal, Weight Watchers, AllTrails, Instacart, and Peloton. Last month, MacRumors discovered icons related to Apple Health within the ChatGPT app, and today's announcement makes the integration official. Once connected, ChatGPT will be able to access your health and fitness data from Apple Health, including movement, sleep, and activity patterns. ChatGPT Health can also integrate with your medical records, allowing ChatGPT Health to analyze your lab results and other aspects of your medical history to inform its answers to your health-related questions. OpenAI emphasizes that ChatGPT Health is not intended to provide diagnoses or treatment and is not a substitute for consulting with medical professionals, but it can be used to help understand results or prepare for upcoming appointments. Privacy and security are always major concerns when it comes to health records, and OpenAI says ChatGPT Health has been developed with multiple layers of encryption and operates as a separate space with enhanced privacy. Data from ChatGPT Health is not used to train ChatGPT's foundation models by default, and users who start health-related conversations in the general ChatGPT interface will receive suggestions to move the discussions to the Health section. ChatGPT Health is launching with a waitlist to join a group of beta users, with users on ChatGPT Free, Go, Plus, and Pro plans outside of the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom eligible to start. Medical record integrations and some apps are only available in the United States at the current time. Access to ChatGPT Health will expand to all users on web and iOS in the coming weeks.

Since the fall of 2024, the company has been training its AI models to use and navigate computers like a human would, and the coding agent has been the most practical expression of that work, giving developers a way to automate rote programming tasks. Starting today, Anthropic is giving regular people a way to take advantage of those capabilities, with the release of a new preview feature called Claude Cowork. The company is billing Cowork as ""a simpler way for anyone not just developers to work with Claude."" After you give the system access to a folder on your computer, it can read, edit or create new files in that folder on your behalf. Anthropic gives a few different example use cases for Cowork. For instance, you could ask Claude to organize your downloads folder, telling it to rename the files contained within to something that's easier to parse at a glance. Another example: you could use Claude to turn screenshots of receipts and invoices into a spreadsheet for tracking expenses. Cowork can also navigate websites provided you install Claude’s Chrome plugin and make can use Anthropic's Connectors framework to access third-party apps like Canva. ""Cowork is designed to make using Claude for new work as simple as possible. You don’t need to keep manually providing context or converting Claude’s outputs into the right format,"" the company said. ""Nor do you have to wait for Claude to finish before offering further ideas or feedback: you can queue up tasks and let Claude work through them in parallel."" If the idea of granting Claude access to your computer sounds ill-advised, Anthropic says Claude ""can’t read or edit anything you don’t give it explicit access to."" However, the company does note the system can ""take potentially destructive actions,"" such as deleting a file that is important to you or misinterpreting your instructions. For that reason, Anthropic suggests it's best to give ""very clear"" guidance to Claude. Anthropic isn’t the first to offer a computer agent. Microsoft, for example, has been pushing Copilot hard for nearly three years, despite seemingly limited adoption. For Anthropic, the challenge will be convincing people these tools are useful where others have failed. The fact Claude Code has been universally loved by programmers may make that task easier. For now, Anthropic is giving users of its pricey Claude Max subscription first access to the preview. If you want to try Cowork for yourself, you'll also need a Mac with the Claude macOS app installed. For everyone else, you’ll need to join a wait list.

In brief The Pentagon plans to deploy AI systems across classified and unclassified military networks. xAI’s Grok will be added to the Pentagon’s GenAI. mil platform alongside Google’s Gemini. Public Citizen warned that Grok’s safety record poses national security risks. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said Monday that the Pentagon is moving to make artificial intelligence a core part of the U. S. military’s capability, using a speech at SpaceX’s Starbase facility in Texas to outline how AI and space technologies will shape future operations. Hegseth said the Pentagon’s objective is to become “an AI-first warfighting force across all domains,” including both internal planning systems and frontline operations. “Simply put, the United States must win the strategic competition for 21st century technological supremacy,” Hegseth said, highlighting artificial intelligence, autonomous systems, quantum, hypersonics, and long-range drones. “If you talk to Elon Musk long enough, he will tell you how important hypersonics and long-range drones are, and he’s 100% correct. Space capabilities, directed energy, and biotechnology are the new areas of global competition.” ﻿ Hegseth said AI will move quickly into broad operational use across the Defense Department. “Very soon, we will have the world’s leading AI models on every unclassified and classified network throughout our department,” he said, calling it “long overdue.” In a nod to the renewed relationship between the Trump Administration and Musk, Hegseth said the Pentagon would begin using Grok. “Today, we’re excited to announce the next frontier AI model company to join GenAI. mil, and that is Grok from xAI, which will go live later this month,” Hegseth said.

People have already died after long, spiraling relationships with these chatbots. Treating them like medical experts seems like it would only make that problem worse. Critics of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT think this is the worst thing you could do with your medical data. Dr. ChatGPT wants your data The ""AI"" company announced ChatGPT Health on Jan. 8, pitching it as a ""dedicated experience that securely brings your health information and ChatGPT’s intelligence together."" The press release argued that people are already asking the bot health questions. Instead of advising people not to do that, this is happening. ""You can securely connect medical records and wellness apps to ground conversations in your own health information, so responses are more relevant and useful to you,"" OpenAI claimed. The company used the word ""secure,"" and variants, an awful lot, and the reasons are clear. The harvesting and sale of data is a huge driver of the tech industry these days, and few LLM critics are buying OpenAI's promises. @DocWhatever/X ""Sooooo share your private medical records to an AI company who can then sell your information to whoever wants to buy it?"" @DocWhatever wrote on X. ""So they can use your health information to develop health technology and train their AI for free so they can get even more rich?"" Others worried about OpenAI's ability to keep records from hackers. ""ALL CHAT BOTS HAVE BAD SECURITY,"" @TehWonderkitty shouted. ""ALL CHAT BOTS CAN BE VERY EASILY HACKED. CHAT BOTS CAN'T BE SUED FOR SHARING YOUR PRIVATE HEALTH INFORMATION."" @TehWonderkitty/X ""DO NOT DO THIS."" Those who have tried talking to ChatGPT about health are already seeing issues. ""We don't trust you enough to treat you as an adult, but please trust us with your PERSONAL HEALTH DETAILS?"" asked @Zyeine_Art. ""I've been rerouted and told 'I can't continue this conversation' for having the audacity to talk about how my chronic health conditions make me feel."" Despite the backlash, Anthropic announced its own version of this horror-Claude for Healthcare. Could ChatGPT Health be a health hazard? Those barriers to discussions about feelings likely have to do with the multiple lawsuits alleging that ChatGPT talked people into death by suicide. Another grieving mother says the bot gave her 18-year-old son advice on taking drugs until he overdosed. These tragedies, combined with LLMs' tendency to hallucinate statistics and studies, have critics issuing dire warnings. ""As a future therapist, I must say DO NOT DO THIS. EVER,"" wrote @kkiwibin. ""We have countless studies on how ineffective AI is regarding human health, and it's mostly because of the fact that IT'S NOT A HUMAN TO HUMAN CONVERSATION."" @melissamedinavo/X ""The lack of data security of medical records & PHI (personal health info) was the reason I left tech,"" claimed @melissamedinavo. ""It is NOT safe, secure, or protected. Do NOT trust it with your physical health; you've seen what it does to mental health, right? Doctors are obligated to help. AI is not.""

OpenAI has just entered into a major multi-billion partnership with Cerebras Systems, which is reportedly backed by Sam Altman. The partnership will see OpenAI purchase up to 750 megawatts of computing power over the next three years. Cerebras Systems is an AI chip startup building purpose-built AI systems to accelerate long outputs from AI models. It attributes its products’ speed to pairing massive compute, memory, and bandwidth together on a single giant chip to eliminate the bottlenecks that cause sluggish inference on conventional hardware. That is what OpenAI plans to capitalize on. OpenAI signs deal with Altman-backed cloud computing provider According to an official statement from OpenAI, integrating Cerebras into its mix of compute solutions, is all about making its AI products respond more rapidly. This means that when users ask a hard question, generate code, create an image, or run an AI agent, the thinking process becomes faster so that the AI can respond in real time, allowing users to do more with it, stay longer, and run higher-value workloads. According to the statement, OpenAI plans to integrate this low-latency capacity into its inference stack in phases, expanding across workloads. Sachin Katti of OpenAI had this to say about the development: “Cerebras adds a dedicated low-latency inference solution to our platform. That means faster responses, more natural interactions, and a stronger foundation to scale real-time AI to many more people.” According to her, this aligns with OpenAI’s compute strategy, which is to build a resilient portfolio that matches the right systems to the right workloads. Speaking about the partnership, Andrew Feldman, co-founder and CEO of Cerebras, expressed delight at the opportunity to partner with OpenAI as it means pairing the world’s leading AI models with the world’s fastest AI processor. “Just as broadband transformed the internet, real-time inference will.",2026-01-14 23:40:16+00:00,True,False

The lab’s goal is to bridge biological and artificial intelligence over decades, first targeting medical use cases before eventually aiming at consumer-scale, everyday interfaces. Rather than chasing Neuralink-style surgical implants, Merge Labs is betting on a different stack. The team is developing new BCI architectures that interact with neurons using molecules instead of electrodes and move data with deep-reaching ultrasound, all while avoiding implants in brain tissue. The long-term vision is high-bandwidth, non-invasive neural interfaces that feel more like consumer hardware than clinical gear. OpenAI’s investment is not just a check. The company has framed BCIs as a crucial next interface layer that can make AI more natural and human-centered, and it plans to feed Merge Labs custom foundation models and AI operating systems tuned to interpret noisy brain signals. In practice, that means OpenAI’s software roadmap and Merge’s hardware ambitions are now tightly coupled around the idea of thought-level interaction with AI. The launch also escalates the rivalry narrative between Sam Altman and Elon Musk. Merge Labs sits in the same frontier space as Neuralink but is culturally closer to AI-native hardware than traditional medtech, and it plugs directly into OpenAI’s broader push into chips, devices, and human augmentation. At the same time, the fact that OpenAI is heavily backing a company Altman co-founded has triggered fresh scrutiny around governance, conflicts of interest, and who gets to own the neural layer of the future.

OpenAI and SoftBank Group are betting big on AI infrastructure, jointly investing $1 billion in SB Energy to construct massive data center campuses-including a 1. 2-gigawatt facility in Texas designed to power the ambitious Stargate project. The deal, announced January 9, 2026, sees each company contributing $500 million to SB Energy, SoftBank’s energy subsidiary. OpenAI has also signed a lease agreement for the Texas data center, located in Milam County, which will create thousands of construction jobs when operational facilities begin coming online later this year.

While that headline figure drew skepticism from industry observers, this billion-dollar deployment represents concrete capital hitting the ground.

In the coming weeks, the company plans to start testing those ads in the U. S., which will directly relate to user prompts and conversations, “so more people can benefit from our tools with fewer usage limits or without having to pay,” the company said. According to OpenAI, the ads will be “clearly labeled” at the bottom of the chat and users can turn off personalization if they want. As for whether the ads will influence the answers ChatGPT provides, OpenAI said the “responses are driven by what’s objectively useful, never by advertising,” and user data and conversations “are protected and never sold to advertisers.” ChatGPT Go, which launched in India last August and has since rolled out in 170 countries, is now coming to the U. S. and everywhere the AI chatbot is available. It’s ChatGPT’s fastest-growing plan, and OpenAI claims it is “among the most affordable AI subscriptions globally.” (Of course, many AI chatbots are free.) ChatGPT Go costs $8 a month, and offers access to its latest model, GPT‑5. 2 Instant, giving users expanded access to messaging, image creation, file uploads, and memory, the company said in a statement. For those who want to avoid ads, more premium subscriptions such as ChatGPT Plus and ChatGPT Pro come ad-free.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said on X changes will apply to ChatGPT free and ChatGPT Go users, who pay a monthly subscription of $8. Plus, Pro, Business and Enterprise tiers will not be affected. Altman pointed to Instagram as a model for the kind of ad experience users can expect, writing, “We will try to make ads ever more useful to users.” Crucial Quote “It is clear to us that a lot of people want to use a lot of AI and don’t want to pay, so we are hopeful a business model like this can work,” Altman wrote on X.

Rebeca Moen Jan 17, 2026 00: 26 OpenAI will test advertisements in ChatGPT’s free and $8/month Go tiers in the coming weeks, keeping premium subscriptions ad-free amid massive infrastructure costs. OpenAI announced plans to test advertisements in ChatGPT within the coming weeks, marking the AI giant’s first foray into ad-supported revenue as infrastructure costs mount. The ads will appear exclusively in the free tier and the new $8/month ChatGPT Go subscription, while Plus ($20/month), Pro ($200/month), Business, and Enterprise users remain ad-free. The timing isn’t coincidental. OpenAI faces a reported $1. 4 trillion infrastructure spending plan over eight years, and the company needs to monetize its massive free user base somehow. How the Ads Will Work Ads will show at the bottom of ChatGPT responses when there’s a relevant product or service based on the current conversation. They’ll be clearly labeled and separated from organic answers. Users can dismiss ads and provide feedback on why. OpenAI outlined five core principles governing the rollout: ads won’t influence ChatGPT’s answers, conversations stay private from advertisers, user data won’t be sold, personalization can be disabled, and the company claims it won’t optimize for time spent in the app. “You need to trust that ChatGPT’s responses are driven by what’s objectively useful, never by advertising,” the company stated in its announcement. The initial test excludes users under 18 and won’t display ads near sensitive topics including health, mental health, or politics. ChatGPT Go Goes Global Alongside the advertising announcement, OpenAI launched ChatGPT Go worldwide at $8/month. The tier-previously available in 171 countries since August-now reaches the U. S. and all markets where ChatGPT operates. Go subscribers get expanded messaging limits, image creation, file uploads, and memory features.

Terrill Dicki Jan 17, 2026 01: 38 OpenAI introduces new U18 Principles to its Model Specification, establishing age-appropriate AI safety guidelines for teenage ChatGPT users ages 13-17. OpenAI has updated its Model Specification-the rulebook governing ChatGPT’s behavior-with new “U18 Principles” specifically designed to protect teenage users. The December 2025 update, developed with input from the American Psychological Association, establishes how the AI assistant should interact with users ages 13 to 17. The move follows OpenAI’s Teen Safety Blueprint unveiled in November 2025 and comes as major tech companies face mounting pressure over youth safety. Meta expanded its own AI safety tools for teens in October 2025, signaling an industry-wide shift toward age-differentiated AI experiences. Four Core Commitments The U18 Principles rest on four pillars: prioritizing teen safety even when it conflicts with other goals, promoting real-world support and offline connections, treating teenagers appropriately rather than as children or adults, and maintaining transparency about the AI’s limitations. ChatGPT will now apply heightened caution when discussions with teen users venture into high-risk territory. This includes self-harm, romantic or sexualized roleplay, explicit content, dangerous activities, substance use, body image issues, and requests for secrecy about unsafe behavior. “APA encourages AI developers to provide developmentally appropriate protections for teen users of their products,” said Dr. Arthur C. Evans Jr., the organization’s CEO. He emphasized that human interaction remains crucial for adolescent development and that AI use should be balanced with real-world connections. Technical Implementation OpenAI is rolling out an age-prediction model across consumer ChatGPT plans. When the system identifies an account as belonging to a minor, teen protections activate automatically. Accounts with uncertain or incomplete age data will default to the U18 experience until adult status is verified. Parental controls now extend to newer products including group.",2026-01-17 02:37:40+00:00,True,False

Key Takeaways Kalshi reports a 68% probability for Elon Musk’s lawsuit success against OpenAI after new evidence emerged. OpenAI documents reveal internal discussions about shifting to a for-profit model, sparking legal tensions. The odds that Elon Musk will win his lawsuit against OpenAI have jumped to 68% on prediction market Kalshi following the release of new court filings suggesting OpenAI leadership contemplated a for-profit pivot earlier than publicly acknowledged. At one point, Musk’s winning chances approached 72% as investors reacted to the revelations in the filings. The documents, submitted by Musk’s legal team, include a section titled “Brockman’s Personal Files,” containing previously private diary entries from OpenAI co-founder and president Greg Brockman. In the notes, Brockman appears to acknowledge internal plans to transition the organization away from its nonprofit mission. In a November 2017 entry, Brockman wrote that the team could not honestly claim a long-term commitment to the nonprofit structure, stating, “If three months later we’re doing b-corp then it was a lie.” Other entries reveal tension between OpenAI’s stated mission and financial ambitions, with Brockman questioning, “Financially, what will take me to $1B?” and later conceding that “it would be nice to be making the billions.” Brockman also anticipated that a for-profit shift would spark a “very nasty fight” with Musk and noted discomfort operating out of office space then controlled by Musk. Following the unsealing of these documents, OpenAI responded with a blog post titled “The Truth Elon Left Out,” disputing Musk’s interpretation. The company argued that Musk himself supported a for-profit structure in 2017 but sought majority equity and unilateral control, which the other founders rejected. OpenAI also contended that Brockman’s diary entries reflect private brainstorming after negotiations with Musk broke down, rather than evidence of a covert plan to deceive him from the outset.

The ads will initially appear in the United States for free and lower-tier subscribers, the company said in a blog post outlining its long-anticipated move. Premium Pro and Enterprise subscribers will remain ad-free. The integration of advertising has been a key question for generative AI chatbots, with companies largely reluctant to interrupt the user experience with ads. But the exorbitant costs of running AI services may have forced OpenAI's hand. Only a small percentage of its nearly one billion users pay for subscription services, putting pressure on the company to find new revenue sources. Since ChatGPT's launch in 2022, OpenAI's valuation has soared to $500 billion in funding rounds, higher than any other private company. Some expect it could go public with a trillion-dollar valuation. But the ChatGPT maker burns through cash at a furious rate, mostly on the powerful computing required to deliver its services. With its move, OpenAI brings its business model closer to tech giants Google and Meta, which have built advertising empires on the back of their free-to-use services. Unlike OpenAI, those companies have massive advertising revenue to fund AI innovation, with Amazon also building a solid ad business on its shopping and video streaming platforms.""Ads aren't a distraction from the gen AI race; they're how OpenAI stays in it,"" said Jeremy Goldman, an analyst at Emarketer.""If ChatGPT turns on ads, OpenAI is admitting something simple and consequential: the race isn't just about model quality anymore; it's about monetizing attention without poisoning trust,"" he added. OpenAI's pivot comes as Google gains ground in the generative AI race, infusing services including Gmail, Maps and YouTube with AI features that in addition to its Gemini chatbot compete directly with ChatGPT. OpenAI Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman has long expressed his dislike for advertising, citing concerns that ads could create distrust about ChatGPT's content. To address these concerns, OpenAI pledged that ads would never influence ChatGPT's answers and that user conversations would remain private from advertisers.""Ads do not influence the answers ChatGPT gives you,"" the company stated. ""Answers are optimized based on what's most helpful to you. Ads are always separate and clearly labeled.""- 'Trust over revenue' -The release was announced by Fidji Simo, OpenAI's CEO of applications, a former Meta executive who oversaw the social media giant's advertising business before leaving for Instacart.""As we introduce ads, it's crucial we preserve what makes ChatGPT valuable in the first place,"" Simo said in a blog post.""That means you need to trust that ChatGPT's responses are driven by what's objectively useful, never by advertising.""In an apparent reference to Meta, TikTok and Google's YouTube -- platforms accused of maximizing user engagement to boost ad views -- OpenAI said it would ""not optimize for time spent in ChatGPT. We prioritize user trust and user experience over revenue,"" it added. The commitment to user well-being is a sensitive issue for OpenAI, which has faced accusations of allowing ChatGPT to privilege emotional engagement over safety, allegedly contributing to mental distress among some users. The move comes as ChatGPT Go, the company's $8 monthly subscription tier, becomes available in the United States and all markets where the service operates.

Key Points: OpenAI tests ads on ChatGPT to explore viable business models. Ads will not influence ChatGPT’s responses. User privacy remains a priority, with no data shared with advertisers. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced on January 17, 2026, that ChatGPT is testing ad features for some users with privacy-focused principles, starting in the US. Altman’s shift highlights a strategy to sustain free AI access amid high operational costs, reflecting industry trends toward integrating advertisements cautiously. OpenAI Explores Ads Amid Rising Financial Needs CEO Sam Altman announced the start of ad testing on ChatGPT for users who prefer not to pay for AI services. This move follows OpenAI’s growing financial needs and the service’s popularity. Despite this, paid subscribers will not see ads. Users’ conversations will not be visible to advertisers, maintaining privacy integrity. Fidji Simo, CEO of Applications, confirmed that ads will not affect ChatGPT’s responses, highlighting trust. Financial impacts are observed as OpenAI’s expenses rise significantly. Testing ads explore new revenue streams to sustain operations. Altman previously expressed reservations about advertising, now onboarding them to meet financial and user requirements. It is clear to us that a lot of people want to use a lot of AI and don’t want to pay, so we are hopeful a business model like this can work. — Sam Altman, CEO, OpenAI Shift in AI Monetization: Privacy and Transparency in Focus Did you know?

OpenAI’s recently surfaced internal call notes reveal Elon Musk’s previous backing for a $10 billion for-profit arm ICO in early 2018 to fund the nonprofit’s projects. Musk’s decision to abandon the ICO and later exit from the AI startup set the company on its current path, combining a controlling nonprofit with a public benefit corporation (PBC). OpenAI’s President, Greg Brockman, said he and Musk agreed back in 2017 that a for-profit structure would be the AI startup’s next phase. However, negotiations hit a snag when the AI startup blatantly refused to give Musk full control of the for-profit arm. The ChatGPT maker also rejected Musk’s proposal to merge the AI startup with his Tesla, opting for alternative means to jointly achieve the objective. In response, Musk stormed out of the AI startup and gave the company a 0% chance of success if it failed to raise billions of dollars. Today, the company’s structure includes a controlling nonprofit that owns equity in the PBC, currently valued at over $130 billion. Musk sues OpenAI for breach of charitable trust In his latest court filing, Musk is suing the AI firm for breach of charitable trust and constructive fraud. However, the AI company seeks to deny Musk any remedy for the alleged misconduct on technical grounds. It asserts that the Tesla boss lacks standing to sue because he made most of his contributions indirectly through personal donor-advised funds (DAFs). The AI company also pointed out that Musk made additional donations through the fiscal sponsor YC. org, which it had designated to receive contributions on its behalf. Meanwhile, Musk calls OpenAI’s arguments “meritless,” emphasizing that the court had already ruled he has standing to sue as a “settlor” of a trust.

OpenAI has already locked in $10 billion worth of chip and cloud deals. Not one of those puts Intel, Google, or Amazon in the driver’s seat. It didn’t happen by chance. It happened because OpenAI doesn’t want to rely on any of them. It wants power spread out. It wants to scale fast. It wants control. Back in November, after Nvidia crushed earnings, Jensen Huang told investors, “Everything that OpenAI does runs on Nvidia today.” That’s true for now. But it’s not going to stay that way much longer. The same week, OpenAI went out and signed a $10 billion deal with Cerebras, a much smaller chipmaker that’s trying to go public. This wasn’t just another deal. It was part of a bigger play: use new players, get more chips, build faster, depend on no one. OpenAI taps Cerebras, Broadcom, AMD to spread chip bets wide The Cerebras deal is just one piece. OpenAI said it will use 750 megawatts of Cerebras chips across phases that run through 2028. These chips will help run its large models and heavier workloads. This comes on top of last year’s $1. 4 trillion infrastructure spree, where it teamed up with Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom. That’s what pushed OpenAI’s valuation to $500 billion in private markets. In September, Jensen committed $100 billion from Nvidia to help build out 10 gigawatts of systems for OpenAI. That’s the same energy used by 8 million homes in a year. Jensen said that it would need 4 to 5 million GPUs. But OpenAI isn’t betting everything on him. Just hours after that was announced, it revealed another 10 gigawatts worth of chips coming from Broadcom. These aren’t standard chips. These are custom AI accelerators, called XPUs.

In brief Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said AI could outperform humans across most tasks within one to five years Both Amodei and Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis warned that entry-level white-collar jobs face early disruption The executives said governments are underestimating the speed and scale of economic and geopolitical risks The timeline for artificial general intelligence (AGI) is tightening, and according to Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, the window for policymakers to prepare is closing faster than many realize. Speaking on a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos alongside Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis, Amodei warned that the rapid evolution of AI is poised to outpace the resilience of labor markets and social institutions. Amodei reaffirmed his aggressive forecast that human-level AI is likely only years, not decades, away. “I don’t think that’s going to turn out to be that far off,” Amodei said, standing by his prediction that superhuman capability could arrive by 2026 or 2027. “It’s very hard for me to see how it could take longer than that.” ﻿ The engine behind this acceleration is a burgeoning feedback loop where AI models have begun to automate their own creation. Amodei noted that at Anthropic, the traditional role of the software engineer is already being redefined by AI. “I have engineers within Anthropic who say, ‘I don’t write any code anymore. I just let the model write the code, I edit it,’” he said. “We might be six to twelve months away from when the model is doing most, maybe all, of what [software engineers] do end to end.” While Amodei sees progress compounding quickly-limited only by chip supply and training cycles-Hassabis offered a more measured outlook. “I think there has been remarkable progress, but some areas of engineering work, coding, or mathematics are easier to see.",2026-01-22 02:04:34+00:00,False,True

He made the announcement during a post-Cabinet media conference at the Diplomatic Centre, St Ann's, on January 22. Smith said TT will join Estonia, Greece, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Slovakia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in piloting the initiative. “The Education for Countries initiative is designed to help nations build future-ready education systems by embedding artificial intelligence tools into schools, universities and to personalise learning, reduce administrative burdens for educators and, importantly, from the public administration side, equip our workforce with the essential skills required for a world increasingly shaped by AI.” Smith said his ministry was formed to advance the modernisation of the public sector and to integrate as much as possible, advanced technologies to promote and move TT into the future of technology. “OpenAI is the global leader in artificial intelligence, research and deployment. This strategic collaboration marks a pivotal milestone in the government’s official policy framework: the positioning of TT as a regional partner in the integration of advanced artificial intelligence technologies into the fabric of national development. “OpenAI is globally recognised for its mission to ensure the advanced intelligence benefits to all of humanity, most notably through its creation of ChatGPT, a tool that has refined productivity, which is very important, and problem solving worldwide.” He said the partnership focuses on three core pillars which remain the vision of the ministry: digital services, smart and efficient government services, and the movement towards a fully realised digital nation. “By introducing advanced capabilities such as ChatGPT Edu, the ministry is ensuring that the nation’s human capital development is prepared to thrive in the global digital economy. The partnership complements the ministry’s ongoing technical collaborations with international bodies to ensure responsible and ethical AI adoptions.” Smith said the ministry is conducting a comprehensive assessment of the nation’s readiness for AI, in collaboration with the UN Development Programme (UNDP) and the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), leveraging UNESCO’s readiness assessment methodology and the UNDP’s landscape assessment. He said he ministry, through the public service academy, is doing a three-day Data to Policy workshop, from January 21-23, with the support of the UNDP digital AI and innovation hub. The workshop equips senior public servants, officials, including the deputy permanent secretaries and senior managers, with practical skills in integrating data and AI into policy development. “TT is not satisfied with being left on the sidelines of the new digital era. We will be pioneers in the space, we will be participants in the space and by these collaborations and through these multi-lateral engagements, we will be seen and continue to be seen as the leaders in technology, both in TT and in the western hemisphere.” Smith said he wanted to make the public servants aware of the usefulness, effectiveness and modernisation of the public service, which would reduce costs for the government and provide benefits to the citizens of TT. Asked what discussions he had been having with respect to maintaining job security given the increased use of AI, Smith said the question was a recurring one. “The position of the ministry and the government has always been that technology should not replace people. We need to augment the technology and have the human capital developed, and that has been the approach of the ministry.” “The ministry has done a number of human development initiatives, not only through the government, but in partnership with best practice partners. We have partnered with the UNDP, UNESCO and agencies that are aware and know the technology and are the leaders in integration and implementation across the globe.” He said job loss was always an area of concern but the population needed to embrace change as this change is happening globally. “We are not unique in terms of AI and how it will impact jobs. What we are trying to do as a government is to prepare our workers to be a part of that transformation. When they develop their skills, they retool, they upskill, this is how we develop our public servants and our citizenry, not only to be partakers in the local economy but the international economy as well.” Smith said the ministry was still looking at the work-from-home policy which the previous administration had begun formulating. “We haven’t actively engaged in the process to date, but it’s something we have been looking at with various partners. We also need to include several ministers in that mix. I’ve already started collaborating with the Labour Minister. So the government is active in terms of its analysis of it. Once there’s further feedback on that, we will be happy to share with the public and the media.” The post Trinidad and Tobago partners with OpenAI for education programme appeared first.",2026-01-23 15:28:03+00:00,True,False

As of today, the chatbot can now connect to platforms like Slack and Canva, fetching up files from inside those apps or performing tasks within them on a user's behalf. For instance, when connected to Box, Claude can now search for files, preview documents inline and answer questions about the content in front of you. Meanwhile, with a connection to Asana, it can now turn chats into projects, tasks and timelines your co-workers can then find and interact with on the project management app. Box and Asana are just two of the platforms adding deeper integrations with Claude today. In total, there are nine launch partners, with some of the more notable ones including Canva, Figma and Slack. As with Anthropic's past integrations, the new functionality is powered by Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. MCP is a technology Anthropic released in fall 2024 to make it easier for third-party platforms to connect their systems to Claude. Since then, the protocol has become an industry standard. OpenAI, for instance, adopted MCP last year, and has been building additional support since then. At the end of last year, Anthropic donated the protocol to the Linux Foundation.
